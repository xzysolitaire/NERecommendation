ESPN.com and the TrueHoop Network are ranking every NBA player -- and counting them down on Twitter (@ESPNNBA), from No. 500 to No. 1. Here are the Heat's rankings: Rank Player Score 1 LeBron James SF | Age: 28 | Stats 2012 rank: #1 @KingJames You're kidding yourself if you think anyone in the game is better than @KingJames right now! #NBArank — †-Lake (@theXTravAgant) October 22, 2013 @ESPNNBA How could a top 5 player of all time, in his prime, be ranked anything less? The throne is LeBron's until further notice #NBARank — Bake (@abake6) October 22, 2013 Next stop Jordan, LeBron number 1 #NBArank — Trent locke (@The1nOnlyTLocke) October 22, 2013 Lebron at 1?
