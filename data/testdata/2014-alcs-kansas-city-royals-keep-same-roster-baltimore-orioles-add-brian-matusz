BALTIMORE -- The Kansas City Royals will enter the AL Championship Series with the same 25-man roster they used in a sweep of the Los Angeles Angels. Manager Ned Yost has an 11-man pitching staff, six outfielders, five infielders, designated hitter Billy Butler and catchers Salvador Perez and Erik Kratz. Baltimore's roster, as expected, does not include suspended first baseman Chris Davis. The Orioles have an 11-man pitching staff that includes left-handed reliever Brian Matusz. He replaced Ubaldo Jimenez, who was part of Baltimore's roster for the ALDS. That was the only change in manager Buck Showalter's roster. Game 1 is scheduled for Friday night, weather permitting.
