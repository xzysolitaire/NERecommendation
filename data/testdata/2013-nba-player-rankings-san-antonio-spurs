Here are the Spurs' rankings: Rank Player Score 12 Tony Parker PG | Age: 31 | Stats 2012 rank: #16 @tonyparker @ESPNNBA @tonyparker That is blasphemous. We're still winning the title. — Jose Cole (@_FutureAnalyst) October 18, 2013 @ESPNNBA @tonyparker Are you guys serious ? MVP contender last year before a late injury slowed him ! 28secs from MVP Finals and he's 12th ? — O Gwadaboy No Brasil (@JuChipo) October 18, 2013 12 years and still hasn't hit 30,000 NBA minutes. The man has some good years left yet. RT @ESPNNBA: #NBArank 12: Tony Parker (@tonyparker) — Clint Peterson (@Clintonite33) October 18, 2013 8.52 16 Tim Duncan PF | Age: 37 | Stats 2012 rank: #27 @ESPNNBA Duncan is one the greatest PF of all time and seems to never age. The guy's like fine wine, gets better with age. #NBArank — Richie (@ChiCity_Rich) October 17, 2013 TD was one rebound away from being Finals MVP. Should've been in the top 10 and ahead of Griffin at least. @ESPNNBA: #NBArank — Ibrahim Toukan (@Iktoukan) October 17, 2013 Every year, Duncan staves off father time. What makes you think he won't this year? #NBArank — Brian Kendall (@TheBrianKendall) October 17, 2013 8.20 34 Kawhi Leonard SF | Age: 22 | Stats 2012 rank: #95 @TheBig_Island @ESPNNBA defense defense defense. this guy was made to play for the Spurs and they're getting every ounce of talent out of him #NBArank — tommyk (@WarninTracPwr) October 14, 2013 From 95 to 34. Not too bad for a 22 year old. ��❤️ "@ESPNNBA: #NBArank 34: Kawhi Leonard (@spurs). http://t.co/BpFSSdnlFk" — #ThinkBlue (@LAfan246) October 14, 2013 7.27 86 Manu Ginobili SG | Age: 36 | Stats 2012 rank: #25 @manuginobili @ESPNNBA Manu has had a stellar career, but how he underperformed during the Finals will leave a black mark almost too hideous to ignore. — DaTrillSpursBorg (@SpursBorg) October 7, 2013 5.95 111 Tiago Splitter C | Age: 28 | Stats 2012 rank: 149 @TiagoSplitter @ESPNNBA Tiago Splitter is pretty much a perennial starting big man or backup big man. Great role player for a contender. #NBArank — bill palisoc (@billpalisoc1) October 3, 2013 5.52 113 Danny Green SG | Age: 26 | Stats 2012 rank: #160 @Dgreen_14 @ESPNNBA @DGreen_14 I don't like his game at all, but he was 2 games shy of a Finals MVP trophy.
