SAN FRANCISCO -- Home run king Barry Bonds has posted on Twitter that he needed surgery on his left hip. The 50-year-old Bonds tweeted a smiling photo Wednesday of himself in a hospital gown announcing the operation on his hip, adding: "I appreciate you all for your prayers. Go Giants." San Francisco has reached the NL Championship Series for the third time in five years. The seven-time NL MVP has become an avid cyclist since his baseball career ended after the 2007 season, when he broke Hank Aaron's home run record of 755 and wound up with 762 over 22 major league seasons.
