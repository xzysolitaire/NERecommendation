Amazing how playoffs can change perception of an average rookie season. "@ESPNNBA: #NBArank 76: Harrison Barnes (@Hbarnes)." — Justin Rowan (@Cavsanada) October 8, 2013 @ESPNNBA @HBarnes Overrated. Seems like he got 76 because of his massive dunk on Pekovic. Granted that dunk was amazing. — Josh Boyden (@josh_boyden) October 8, 2013 6.13 206 Draymond Green SF | Age: 23 | Stats 2012 rank: #334 @Money23Green @ESPNNBA @Money23Green every playoff team has a Draymond team. someone who can do a little of everything. — tommyk (@WarninTracPwr) September 26, 2013 4.31 233 Marreese Speights PF | Age: 26 | Stats 2012 rank: #195 @Mospeights16 @ESPNNBA essentially replaces Carl Landry and may do more than he did last year. #LetsGoWarriors #NBArank — Nathan Cody Castro (@L4verra) September 25, 2013 4.04 267 Festus Ezeli C | Age: 23 | Stats 2012 rank: #429 @fezzyfel @ESPNNBA @fezzyfel his stats might make you believe that #267 is justified.
