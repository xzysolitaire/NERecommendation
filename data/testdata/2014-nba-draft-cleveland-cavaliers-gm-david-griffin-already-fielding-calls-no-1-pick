SVP & Russillo Cavaliers GM David Griffin weighs in on receiving the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft lottery, what comes next for Kyrie Irving, Anthony Bennett's struggles and more. More Podcasts Â» David Griffin's phone started buzzing immediately after the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA draft lottery Tuesday night. And the calls weren't all to offer congratulations. The Cavaliers' general manager says teams throughout the league already were contacting him about potential trades for the No. 1 pick, something he'll think long and hard about leading into the June 26 draft. "I actually got calls right afterward, while I was standing there doing media," Griffin said Wednesday during an interview on ESPN Cleveland's "The Really Big Show." "Teams were already reaching out and texting, so I think it will be an active period of time." This marks the second straight year the Cavaliers have won the No. 1 pick in the draft and third time in the past four overall. This time, though, they moved up from the ninth spot despite just a 1.7 percent chance of winning the top selection, a dose of luck that Cleveland vice chairman Jeff Cohen later called "surreal." Griffin will be in charge this time and will have to choose between the likes of Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid and Jabari Parker. Sources told ESPN's Jeff Goodman that the 7-foot Embiid is the early front-runner for the top pick as long as his back is OK. Then again, Griffin could trade the pick if he thinks it would serve the team best. "I've said many times that I'd trade me if it made us better," he told "The Really Big Show." "We're going to be open-minded to whatever it is that advances our cause the furthest." Information from ESPN's Jeff Goodman was used in this report.
