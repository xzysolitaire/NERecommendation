ESPN.com and the TrueHoop Network are ranking every NBA player -- and counting them down on Twitter (@ESPNNBA), from No. 500 to No. 1. Here are the Mavericks' rankings: Rank Player Score 26 Dirk Nowitzki PF | Age: 35 | Stats 2012 rank: #11 @swish41 @ESPNNBA If @swish41 hadn't dealt w/ injuries last year, @dallasmavs would have made the playoffs. Look for both to bounce back. #NBArank — DK (@electriclight41) October 15, 2013 Dirk is obviously not in his prime anymore, but he still makes the other team respect his shot.
