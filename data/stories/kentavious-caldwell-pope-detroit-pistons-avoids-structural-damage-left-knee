An MRI has showed that Detroit Pistons guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope suffered no structural damage in his left knee. The Pistons announced that the injury, originally called a sprained knee, was reclassified as a left-knee strain. The team said Caldwell-Pope will be re-evaluated after the team's three preseason games this week. Caldwell-Pope was injured in the third quarter in the Pistons' 91-89 exhibition loss to the Washington Wizards on Sunday. Caldwell-Pope, a second-year player out of Georgia, fell underneath Washington's basket and needed assistance getting to the locker room. He did not return after scoring 12 points in 24 minutes. Caldwell-Pope is averaging 16.7 points through Detroit's first three preseason games after scoring 5.9 per game in his rookie season. He joins Will Bynum (right hamstring) and Jodie Meeks (back spasms) as Pistons guards dealing with injuries.
