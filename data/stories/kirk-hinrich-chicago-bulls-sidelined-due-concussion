DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Chicago Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich suffered a concussion in Friday night's win over the Indiana Pacers and is expected to miss "a couple days," according to coach Tom Thibodeau. "He's out. He has a concussion," Thibodeau said after Saturday's practice. "Not sure (how long he'll be out). Probably a couple days." Thibodeau acknowledged that Hinrich will have to be cleared under the NBA concussion policy in order to return. Hinrich was injured in the fourth quarter after he fell into rookie Erik Murphy's knee. "The league protocol, he'll have to go through a series of tests," Thibodeau said. "Make sure he's OK. He said he was feeling a lot better today." Thibodeau was hopeful that Hinrich would be back before the end of the preseason. Bulls forward Jimmy Butler is hopeful he will be back on the floor for Monday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks but he admitted he still has some discomfort in his knee. He has missed the last two games because of knee soreness. "(I feel) a lot better," he said. "Moving a little bit. Just getting shots up. Trying to cut, get my pace up to par." Butler and Hinrich aren't the only ones dealing with injuries. All-Star Joakim Noah was shut down by the organization on Friday as he continues to deal with a groin injury. The good news for the Bulls is that Derrick Rose did everything Saturday in practice after dropping 32 points in 31 minutes on Friday night.
