DALLAS -- Mavericks forward Devin Ebanks has been suspended by the NBA for two games without pay after he entered a no-contest plea to driving under the influence of alcohol, the league said Monday. Ebanks' suspension will begin with the first game of the 2013-14 regular season for which he is eligible and physically able to play. He signed a nonguaranteed contract with the Mavs this summer and is a long shot to make the team. Ebanks, 23, was arrested on Nov. 9, 2012, when he was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. The arrest occurred after Ebanks was stopped for committing a traffic violation at 2:49 a.m., according to the California Highway Patrol. In three seasons with the Lakers, Ebanks averaged 3.6 points and 1.9 rebounds in 63 games.
