IRVING, Texas -- The Kyle Orton Watch will have to continue for the Dallas Cowboys. While coach Jason Garrett said more than a few times that he anticipated Orton would attend this week's mandatory minicamp, the backup quarterback did not show up for Monday's physical, according to multiple sources. And league sources have told ESPN's Ed Werder that some in the Cowboys organization no longer expect Orton to report to the team's mandatory minicamp, which began Tuesday. By missing the physical, Orton is subject to a $10,930 fine. If he does not show up Tuesday, he would face a fine of $11,575. If he misses all three days of the minicamp, the maximum fine is $69,455. Orton's agent, David Dunn, could not be reached for comment. If he decides to play, Orton's base salary will already be docked $75,000 because of a de-escalator in his contract for missing too many workouts. Orton, 32, has been weighing whether he wants to continue playing. He started the Week 17 finale against the Philadelphia Eagles and completed 30 of 46 passes for 358 yards, two touchdowns and had two interceptions in the Cowboys' 24-22 loss. If he decides to retire, Orton would be forced to repay $3.4 million of his signing bonus, which he received in 2011 and 2013. He received a $5 million signing bonus in 2012, and the team converted $510,000 of his $1.35 million base salary in 2013 into a signing bonus for cap relief. If the Cowboys decide to cut him, then he would not have to repay anything. The Cowboys have anticipated Orton's appearance at the minicamp because of the fine. If he fails to report to training camp in Oxnard, Calif., he would be subject to a daily fine of $30,000, per the collective bargaining agreement. He was scheduled to make $3.25 million in base salary this season. With the potential fines and de-escalator, Orton's base salary is roughly $3.09 million. With Tony Romo being held out of competitive drills after December back surgery and Orton's absence, Brandon Weeden has gotten work with the first-team offense and has impressed the coaches. The Cowboys signed veteran Caleb Hanie in April after Orton did not show up for the conditioning program. They also signed Dustin Vaughan as an undrafted rookie.
