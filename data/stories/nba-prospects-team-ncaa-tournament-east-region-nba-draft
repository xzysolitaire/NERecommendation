South | Midwest | East | West This year's NCAA tournament East Region is loaded with good teams, but there is a dearth of NBA prospects in this part of the bracket. By my count we have just one lottery pick and just one other potential first-rounder -- and they both play for the same team. And when compared to the South Region's 13 potential first-round prospects, the East seems particularly barren of next-level players. Insider's NBA draft team has talked to multiple NBA scouts and GMs over the course of the season, and based on their feedback and information, here's a look at the top NBA prospects for each of the teams in the East Region, listed by potential lottery picks, first-rounders, second-rounders and "wait until next year" players. (Teams listed by seed.) 1. Virginia Cavaliers Potential second-rounders: Joe Harris, SG, senior; Akil Mitchell, PF, senior Wait until next year: Mike Tobey, C, sophomore Harris has been an intriguing prospect since his junior year. He flirted with coming out then, but was slated to go in the second round. Harris regressed in virtually every category this year and, despite his team's success, has dropped to the second-round bubble. A strong performance during a title run would help him regain sure footing in the second round.
