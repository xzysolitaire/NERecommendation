MINNEAPOLIS -- The Phoenix Suns have signed Leandro Barbosa to a 10-day contract, bringing the veteran guard back to the place he put his name on the NBA map. The Suns announced the signing Wednesday. Barbosa spent his first seven seasons with the Suns, averaging 12.6 points from 2003 to 2010. The Brazilian guard was a sparkplug off the bench for those fast-paced teams, and the Suns could use a little jolt with starting guard Eric Bledsoe out with a sprained right knee. Barbosa played 41 games for the Boston Celtics last season before tearing the ACL in his left knee on Feb. 11. Barbosa has also spent time with the Raptors and Pacers since leaving Phoenix in 2010. He finished last season with Washington but did not play while recovering from his injury.
