The Chicago Bulls have told Carlos Boozer it is possible he will be waived using the amnesty provision, but the team has made no final decisions, sources told ESPN.com. The Bulls met with free agent Carmelo Anthony on Tuesday and have a visit planned with free agent Pau Gasol on Thursday. To clear salary-cap space for either, the Bulls will have to release Boozer or use him in a sign-and-trade deal. Boozer is in the final year of a contract that will pay him $16.8 million this season. The Bulls have until July 18 to use the amnesty clause on Boozer, which would remove his salary from their books. In that case, teams with cap space would be able to bid on Boozer in a waiver process. He would be awarded to the highest bidder to pay a portion of his salary. He would become a free agent only if there were no bids. Currently, if the Bulls were to waive Boozer, they would have about $9.7 million in cap space. If he is used in a sign-and-trade, the Bulls would be able to take back more than $20 million in salary. This is why the Bulls are leaving their options open with the veteran forward, sources said. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Boozer already had been informed the Bulls would use the amnesty provision on him. Boozer averaged 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game last season when he rarely played in fourth quarters.
