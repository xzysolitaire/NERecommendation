PITTSBURGH -- Pirates manager Clint Hurdle underwent successful surgery on Monday to replace his ailing right hip. The 57-year-old Hurdle spent most of the 2014 season dealing with arthritis in the hip, which made walking painful. He put off surgery until the completion of the season rather than disrupt the team in the middle of the year. Pittsburgh went 88-74 and earned a second consecutive playoff berth before falling to San Francisco in the wild-card round. Hurdle is expected to make a full recovery well in advance of the 2015 season.
