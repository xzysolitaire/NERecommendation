After being declared physically unable to perform last week, it appears Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate will not miss any practices at all. The offseason free-agent signing was taken off the active PUP list Monday and is expected to participate when the Lions have their first training camp practice of the season in the afternoon. Tate was Detroit's biggest signing of the offseason, coming to the Lions on a five-year, $31 million deal to play alongside Calvin Johnson and give quarterback Matthew Stafford another target. The receiver missed part of spring workouts with an injured shoulder, but has since said the injury was "just a little soreness" in June. Tate had career highs of 64 catches for 898 yards last season and also had five touchdowns for the Super Bowl-champion Seattle Seahawks.
