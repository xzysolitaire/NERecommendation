The 2014-15 NBA season could be another one without Andrew Bynum. The oft-injured No. 10 pick in the 2005 draft is considering sitting out next season in order to undergo the Regenokine knee therapy procedure, his agent, David Lee, told the New York Post. The non-surgical procedure uses injections to help grow new cartilage, and requires an extra-long rehab. Lee said Bynum is considering doing the program with German doctor Peter Wehling, who has worked with Kobe Bryant and Alex Rodriguez in the past. The procedure is not approved in the United States. If Bynum successfully completes the program, he could return in 2015-16, according to Lee, who said the Knicks potentially would be interested in the 7-footer. "If he's healthy, Phil [Jackson] will be interested," Lee told the Post, referring to the Knicks team president who coached Bynum while with the Lakers. "Phil knew how to tap into Andrew. They got along famously." Bynum, a former All-Star, didn't play in 2012-13 because of bad knees. Last season, he played in 24 games for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded him to the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls eventually waived the one-time All-Star, and he signed with the Indiana Pacers, playing just two games for them. In 2011-12, Bynum's last full season, he made the All-Star team, averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds per game.
