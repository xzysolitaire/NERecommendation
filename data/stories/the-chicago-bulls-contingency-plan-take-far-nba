After two seasons of injury-inflicted limbo, it's easy for a jaded NBA fan in Chicago to see this offseason as bittersweet. After winning more regular-season games than any team in the league during Tom Thibodeau's first two seasons as head coach, Chicago's vaunted depth fell victim to cap considerations and an injured knee. The Bulls made the playoffs each of the past two seasons and even won a postseason series, but it was the summer of 2014 that beckoned. This was going to be the time when the Bulls would not only welcome Derrick Rose back into the fold, but they'd be able to surround him with the star power that would propel Chicago into title contention.
