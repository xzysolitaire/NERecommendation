The Memphis Grizzlies struck a deal Thursday to re-sign guard Beno Udrih, according to sources close to the process. Sources told ESPN.com that Udrih, who was claimed off waivers from New York last season by the Grizzlies, will sign a two-year deal to stay with Memphis. The contract will start at the league's bi-annual exception valued at $2.1 million. The deal, sources said, will be made official this week after the league-wide moratorium on signings and trades was lifted Thursday.
