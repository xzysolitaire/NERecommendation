Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesEric Bledsoe is the cornerstone of a Phoenix Suns team that could be good for a while. Is it possible to win too much? Fans eyeing the 2014 NBA draft lottery have had to ask that about their teams this season, and none more so than fans of the Phoenix Suns, who have gone from projected West cellar-dwellers to surprising playoff contenders. While Phoenix still could have as many as four first-round choices next June, the Suns' own choice now looks likely to fall in the tail end of the lottery if not outside it entirely.
