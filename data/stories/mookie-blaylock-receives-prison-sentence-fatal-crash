Former NBA guard Mookie Blaylock pleaded guilty Monday and received reduced prison time for his role in a suburban Atlanta car crash that killed a mother of five. Blaylock was sentenced to 15 years for vehicular homicide and other charges in the death of Monica Murphy in a head-on collision in Clayton County on May 31, 2013. According to the plea deal, the term was reduced to seven years -- suspended after three -- and eight years' probation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution initially reported the terms of Blaylock's sentencing. At the time of the wreck, Blaylock, 47, had been under treatment for seizures, the Journal-Constitution reported, citing a family member. Before the crash, a doctor had ordered Blaylock not to drive, prosecutors said. Blaylock starred in college at Oklahoma and was a first-round draft pick of the New Jersey Nets in 1989. He spent the bulk of his 13-year pro career with the Atlanta Hawks and was an All-Star selection in 1994. That season he averaged 17.4 points and 5.9 assists.
