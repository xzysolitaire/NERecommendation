PORTLAND, Ore. -- The Chicago Bulls were without Derrick Rose (strained left hamstring), Pau Gasol (strained left calf) and Kirk Hinrich (bruised ribs) against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night. It marked the fourth straight game Rose has missed because of the hamstring he initially injured in last Thursday night's win over the Toronto Raptors. It is the eighth game Rose missed overall; he missed four games earlier in the year after spraining both of his ankles. "(He's) just day-to-day," Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said of Rose's status. "It's just the same. Same stuff." Rose declined comment before the game, through a Bulls' spokesperson. It is almost a year to the day that Rose tore the medial meniscus in his right knee against the Trail Blazers in the Moda Center. Hinrich had X-rays after Thursday night's loss to the Sacramento Kings that came back negative. He took a couple hard shots to the chest, including taking a charge from Kings big man DeMarcus Cousins, but the veteran guard said that his ribs are what's bothering him the most. The Bulls initially listed Hinrich as having a chest contusion. "(I'm) very sore," Hinrich said before Friday's game. "Just one of those things. I got banged up pretty good last night and just didn't recover. Didn't have enough time to recover for tonight." Hinrich said he is "day-to-day" and is hopeful he'll feel better Saturday. The Bulls aren't scheduled to practice again until Sunday. Gasol said Thursday he was hopeful he would be able to return quickly, but wanted to be cautious so that the injury could heal. He has now missed three straight games after initially straining the calf in last Saturday's loss to the Indiana Pacers.
