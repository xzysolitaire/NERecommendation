LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Darren Collison was a late scratch in Sunday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, missing the game with a stomach virus. Willie Green started in his place. Collison was thrust into the starting lineup because J.J. Redick is out indefinitely with a bulging disk in his lower back while Jamal Crawford will be sidelined at least another week with a strained left calf. Collison, who is hoping to be back for Monday's game against the Denver Nuggets, has started 26 of 67 games for the Clippers this season with the team going 20-6 with him in the starting lineup. Collison is averaging 16.3 points per game in March while shooting 49.4 percent from the field.
