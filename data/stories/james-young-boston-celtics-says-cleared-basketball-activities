Boston Celtics rookie swingman James Young said Tuesday that he has been cleared to return to basketball activities after the pre-draft car accident that forced him to miss summer league. Young sustained a concussion and whiplash in a car accident before last month's NBA draft. The Celtics chose the 6-foot-6 swingman 17th overall with its second first-round pick but held Young out of practices and the competition for young players and free agents in Orlando. Young said Tuesday that he was cleared to practice a "few days ago," adding that the scary rear-end collision showed him "how fast things can change. It really opened my eyes about things and I'm very blessed that I'm here and still playing."
