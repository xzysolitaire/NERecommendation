Chris Bosh averaged at least 22.3 points in each of his last five seasons in Toronto. In fact, in Bosh's last season with the Raptors, in 2009-10, he was the NBA's ninth-leading scorer (24 ppg). Then, at age 26, in the prime of his career, he made the leap to join the Miami Heat. In some ways it had to be humbling, because to be successful on a team with the game's biggest star, LeBron James, and the Heat's longtime icon, Dwyane Wade, it required Bosh to take a backseat. His numbers immediately fell -- and drastically so. He dropped down to 18.7 ppg in his first season in South Beach, and his rebounds went from 10.8 per game in Toronto to 8.3 in Miami. The joke around the NBA, if you recall, was that the "Big Three" should in fact be called the "Big Two-And-A-Half." Fast-forward four years, and it's now clear that Bosh's willingness to play a specific role on Miami's star-studded roster, even while being overshadowed by LeBron and D-Wade, played a huge part in the Heat's two championships. This has to be something weighing on the mind of just about every Kevin Love fantasy owner right now, because there's a distinct possibility Love could be on the same path this season (if he's willing).
