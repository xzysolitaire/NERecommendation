A "missing child alert" was issued Monday by former Pacers star Reggie Miller and others for the TNT analyst's niece, who sparked a police search after she went missing from her home, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said. Nikki Miller, 16, is believed to have intentionally run away from her Yorba Linda, California, home, prompting detectives to decide against treating the case as an abduction, Lt. John Roche told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. Miller is about 6 feet tall, weighs 150 pounds and has dark hair and brown eyes, police said. Miller's uncle, Reggie, tweeted to his nearly 600,000 followers late Monday afternoon to get the word out about his niece's disappearance. Nikki Miller's bedroom was found empty at 7:17 a.m. local time and her relatives alerted the authorities after they realized the teenager was missing. Officers immediately dispatched to the scene found no evidence that led them to conclude she was taken from her house against her will, Roche said. "Nothing lets us believe that anything bad happened," Roche was quoted as saying. "As with most teenagers, when they get hungry or run out of money, they want to come home."
