SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Phoenix forward P.J. Tucker was charged with "extreme drunken driving" two months before he signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract -- $12.7 million guaranteed -- with the Suns. Scottsdale police say Tucker had a blood alcohol level of .222 percent -- nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08 for operating a vehicle in Arizona. Tucker's Mercedes Benz was pulled over by a Scottsdale police officer on May 10. The police report says Tucker's speech was slurred and eyes were bloodshot, and he nearly fell over during the sobriety test. Tucker's attorney Melanie Beauchamp declined on Tuesday to comment on the arrest. The Suns said they were aware of the incident but had no comment while the case remains in court. Tucker signed his contract with the Suns last week.
