Colorado junior Spencer Dinwiddie announced on Thursday he will leave school for the NBA. The 6-foot-6 point guard tore the ACL in his left knee Jan. 12 against Washington. He was averaging 14.7 points, 3.8 assists and 3.1 rebounds at the time and was considered a late first-round pick. Now there remains uncertainty among NBA executives, with some feeling Dinwiddie still has a chance to go late in the first round and others telling ESPN.com that he'll most likely fall into the second round. Colorado finished 23-12 last season, but the Buffaloes were 9-9 without Dinwiddie in the lineup. They lost to Pittsburgh in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Tad Boyle's team returns the rest of its starting lineup from last season and will add a Top 100 point guard in Dominique Collier.
