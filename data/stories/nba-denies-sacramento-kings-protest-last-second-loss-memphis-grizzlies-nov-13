The NBA said Friday that commissioner Adam Silver has denied the Sacramento Kings' protest of a Nov.13 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Kings said Courtney Lee's game-winning shot should have been disqualified as having been made after time expired. Silver determined that the game officials' call that Lee's shot was timely was within their judgment and not a misapplication of the playing rules. Sacramento's protest therefore did not justify the extraordinary remedy of overturning the game's result. Memphis won 111-110 on Lee's last-second basket. The play was reviewed on the court by officials. They not only checked whether Lee got the shot off before the buzzer, but whether the Kings tipped the inbounds pass. That would have started the clock earlier, causing time to run out before Lee's attempt. The Kings blew a 26-point lead in the loss.
