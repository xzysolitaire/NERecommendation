This file was updated Oct. 17. Fantasy basketball never lacks storylines, and already this preseason we've seen several write themselves as injuries to the likes of Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Nick Young have altered plans and completely changed draft-day strategies. Let ESPN Insider's 2014-15 Fantasy Basketball Cheat Sheet serve as a one-stop shop for all the intel you need to get the inside edge and take home the championship in your league. This year, we offer the latest insight on the players who are sliding in drafts and the ones who are being selected above their predraft rankings. Our team of Insiders also offers sleepers at each of the five positions and a whole lot more, including: • Amin Elhassan provides his top "one-tool threats." • Kevin Pelton reveals his list of the players who are most likely to outperform or underperform their WARP projections. • Bradford Doolittle projects which players likely will get a sharp rise in minutes. • Joe Kaiser provides you with the rookies you should target, the ones to avoid, deep-sleeper rookies, and top second-year breakout candidates. Be sure to also check out our handy guide that lists which teams play the most (and fewest) games during the all-so-important playoff weeks. Good luck from all of us at ESPN Insider this season; hopefully we can help the ball bounce your way!
