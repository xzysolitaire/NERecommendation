MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Grizzlies guard/forward Quincy Pondexter is out indefinitely with a stress fracture in his right foot. Memphis announced that Pondexter had an MRI on Monday that revealed the severity of his injury. Pondexter hurt his foot Saturday night in a 108-82 loss to the Golden State Warriors. "It was the news I was not expecting," Pondexter said before Monday night's game between the Grizzlies and the Orlando Magic. "I was expecting maybe a week or two or a couple of weeks. I didn't think this." Pondexter, who walked out for the pregame availability on crutches, said the injury happened on the first play of Saturday's game when he was guarding Warriors guard Klay Thompson and fighting over a screen. "Just the way I took off, it wasn't feeling right," Pondexter said. "That's kind of when the impact happened." He tried to play through the injury, but left the game in the second quarter. The 25-year-old Pondexter was averaging 6.3 points, 1.7 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 18 minutes per game this season after signing a four-year contract extension Oct. 31. Pondexter wrote on Twitter that he still couldn't believe the news himself. "But I GUARANTEE I will be back next season BETTER THAN EVER!! Joshua 1:9," Pondexter wrote. Expanding on it before Monday's game, Pondexter said: "I've been told it's going to be awhile. We haven't had surgery or a timetable on what we are going to do yet. Once we get down to that in next week or two, I think I'll have a good idea of how long it is going to take. If there's an opportunity for myself to come back or whatever, I'm going to do whatever it takes." Pondexter is just the latest injury the Grizzlies have had this season. Center Marc Gasol is out indefinitely after spraining the MCL in his left knee, and Zach Randolph, Tony Allen and Ed Davis have missed games recently with injuries.
