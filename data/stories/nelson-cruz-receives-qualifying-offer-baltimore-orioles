The Baltimore Orioles have made a qualifying offer to Nelson Cruz, the team announced on Monday. Teams have until 5 p.m. ET Monday to extend free agents these $15.3 million qualifying offers. By doing so, teams ensure they will receive compensation picks in the 2015 first-year player draft if the offered players choose to sign elsewhere. Cruz has until 5 p.m. ET on Nov. 10 to accept or decline the Orioles' offer. Cruz, 34, led the majors with 40 home runs and finished third in the American League with 108 RBIs. Cruz signed a one-year, $8 million deal with the Orioles on Feb. 24. He was suspended for 50 games on Aug. 5, 2013 for his involvement with Biogenesis. Cruz has previously played with the Milwaukee Brewers (eight games in 2005) and Texas Rangers (2006-2013). The three-time All-Star holds MLB records for most home runs (six) and most RBIs (13) in a single postseason series (2011 ALCS). The Orioles also reinstated Manny Machado and Matt Wieters from the 60-day disabled list on Monday.
