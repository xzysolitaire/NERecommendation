INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- It is still a toss-up as to whether LeBron James will bring his pregame chalk toss ritual back in Cleveland this season. "I may," James said Friday when asked if he has thought about resuming his patented powder poof. "I'm going to let the fans decide and see what they think. If they want me to, I will do it." James said he will seek fan input on social media in order to make the call. Over the summer, James went a similar crowd-sourcing route to determine whether to wear his old No. 23 for the Cleveland Cavaliers or stick to No. 6, the number he wore while winning two championships with the Miami Heat and two Olympic gold medals with USA Basketball. James has already hinted at going back to the chalk toss -- a variation of the same habit Kevin Garnett does and Michael Jordan used to do -- by posting a video on Instagram back in August.  At the Cavs' media day last month, James said he would leave it up to his two boys -- Bryce Maximus and LeBron Jr. -- to decide if he should return to the chalk toss, but he now says it's all in the fans' control. "My boys don't need anything," James said. "As long as I'm in uniform, that's all they care about." The pregame chalk toss was a staple for James for most of his career before he stopped the practice during the 2011 playoffs.
