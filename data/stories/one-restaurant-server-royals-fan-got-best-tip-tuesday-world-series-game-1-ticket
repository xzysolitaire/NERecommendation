The Kansas City Royals might not have given fans what they wanted in the team's first World Series game since 1985. One fan, though, had the night of a lifetime after getting a ticket in a most unexpected way. According to local station KMBC, Ryan O'Connor, a server at suburban Kansas City restaurant Rock & Brews, was waiting on the wife of Royals relief pitcher Wade Davis, Katelyn, on Tuesday. Then, after the meal ... "I started to walk away when I dropped off their check after they paid, and they said, 'Hold on, I was going to give you a tip, but instead we thought you might want this," O'Connor told KMBC. "And they said, 'You're going to sit with us -- we're a pretty cool family.'" Of course Rock & Brews gave O'Connor the night off. And although the Royals lost 7-1 to the San Francisco Giants, O'Connor wasn't about to complain.
