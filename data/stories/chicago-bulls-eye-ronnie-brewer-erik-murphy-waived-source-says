The Chicago Bulls waived rookie forward Erik Murphy on Thursday, and a source tells ESPNChicago.com's Nick Friedell that the team is considering bringing back former Bulls forward Ronnie Brewer or Mike James to take his roster spot. The 6-foot-10 Murphy, a second-round pick (49th overall) in the 2013 NBA draft, played 24 games with the Bulls and averaged 0.3 points a game in 2.6 minutes. Brewer, who played with the Bulls for two seasons from 2010-12, was waived by the Houston Rockets after they tried unsuccessfully to deal him by the trade deadline in February. A seven-year veteran, the 6-7 Brewer has bounced around since leaving the Bulls, playing for the New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston. He played in 22 games this season with the Rockets, averaging 0.3 points and 6.9 minutes a game. James had a stint with the Bulls earlier this season. He was waived when they signed D.J. Augustin in December, but the Bulls brought back James on a 10-day contract in January.
