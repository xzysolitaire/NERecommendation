Get a good look at Anthony Davis, America. The FIBA World Cup might be your best chance for a while to see the monster that is taking over the NBA. The FIBA World Cup officially kicks off this weekend after a series of exhibition games that have done little to shake Team USA's standing as the FIBA favorites. With Paul George injured and Kevin Durant having withdrawn from competition, Team USA has indeed lost some star power in recent weeks, but the silver lining is that the team is now firmly in the ubiquitous hands of Davis. Make sure to get your fill now. With five games in the next six days, the national audience will have an opportunity to see Davis more in the next week than they will all NBA season. Because New Orleans represents the NBA's smallest TV market, the Pelicans will be featured on national television only twice this season, with seven other tilts being broadcast on NBATV. It's time to embrace the Year of Anthony Davis. And it all starts right now in the FIBA World Cup.
