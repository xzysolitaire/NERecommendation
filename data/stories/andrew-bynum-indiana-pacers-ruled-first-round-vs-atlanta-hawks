INDIANAPOLIS -- Top-seeded Indiana won't have Andrew Bynum for its first-round series against Atlanta. Coach Frank Vogel said Thursday that he believes the Pacers' oft-injured center still could work his way back for the playoffs. But he won't be available for the first round, which opens Saturday in Indianapolis. The Pacers signed the free agent in early February with hope he would add depth behind All-Star center Roy Hibbert. Bynum looked good in his Pacers debut, finishing with eight points and 10 rebounds. But he hasn't played since March 15 because of a sore right knee.
