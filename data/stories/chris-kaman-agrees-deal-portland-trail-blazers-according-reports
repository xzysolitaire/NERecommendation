Free-agent center Chris Kaman has agreed to a two-year, $9.8 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers, according to multiple reports.  The Blazers had targeted finding a frontcourt player in free agency but were limited by salary-cap constraints. They first pursued Spencer Hawes, but quickly moved on to Kaman when Hawes drew interest from other teams including the Warriors, Clippers and Suns.  Hawes ultimately agreed to a four-year, $23 million deal with the Clips, sources confirmed to ESPN.com. Kaman, 32, averaged 10.4 points and 5.9 rebounds in a career-low 18.9 minutes last season. The Lakers often utilized a smaller lineup in games, contributing to his limited minutes.  Kaman, who was an All-Star in 2010, is expected to back up starting center Robin Lopez.  The deal will become official when the league-wide moratorium on signings ends July 10.
