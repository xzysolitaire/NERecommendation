CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bobcats coach Steve Clifford reserve shooting guard Gary Neal could miss "two to three games" with a sprained left ankle. Clifford said Wednesday that Neal "wants to play, but to me he's obviously not 100 percent." Neal was 0 for 8 in Charlotte's loss Monday night to Houston and several of his shots hit off the front of the rim. The Bobcats traded for Neal to give them added outside shooting to aid their playoff run. He's averaging 10.5 points. Clifford says "We'll bring him back when he's ready to play. He's just not able physically to play right now." Brooklyn's Deron Williams missed the shootaround Wednesday morning with an illness, but coach Jason Kidd says his point guard will play Wednesday night against the Bobcats.
