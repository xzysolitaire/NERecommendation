SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento Kings have signed forward Royce White to a second 10-day contract, the team said Tuesday. Sacramento first signed White to a 10-day contract March 6, and he reported to the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League. He has started four games for Reno, averaging 8.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 24.8 minutes. White has yet to play for the Kings, who just completed a seven-game trip. Sacramento hosts Washington on Tuesday night. He was drafted 16th overall out of Iowa State by Houston in 2012. He never played for the Rockets after the sides couldn't agree on how to treat his anxiety disorder, which includes a fear of flying.
