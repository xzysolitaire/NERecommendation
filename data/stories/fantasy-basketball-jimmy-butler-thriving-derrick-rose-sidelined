Derrick Rose is officially listed as questionable for Thursday night's nationally televised game (TNT, 10:30 ET) against Sacramento. On Wednesday, Rose told reporters his strained left hamstring felt a lot better, an encouraging sign and possibly an indication that the Bulls will have their starting point guard back after missing the past two games. But if Rose sits out another game, nobody will be surprised. Not anymore. All told, the 26-year-old has played in just 15 games since tearing the ACL in his left knee early in the playoffs in April 2012. And since that crushing moment, Rose has become more associated with aches and pains than quickness and strength. Already this season, he's sprained both ankles, pulled a hamstring and missed six of the Bulls' 11 games. Questionable? It's almost to be expected on a game-to-game basis for Rose and anyone who has him on their fantasy roster. "At this stage, I don't know how anyone can be confident that Rose will be able to stay healthy," ESPN Insider Amin Elhassan said. "Until something drastically changes, the Bulls have to plan as if he will not be available at all times. The Deron Williams situation in Brooklyn last season is a good comparison." One positive to come out of all of this, at least from a fantasy perspective, is that Rose's prolonged absences have opened the door for other players on the Bulls to step up. We saw that happen last season with D.J. Augustin, a former first-round pick who flourished in 61 games with Chicago, averaging 14.9 points, five assists and 2.2 3-pointers per game. This season, the clear beneficiary is Jimmy Butler, whose soaring usage rate has coincided with a vastly improved offensive game that has seen the 2011 first-rounder go from a 39.7 percent shooter in 2013-14 to a 50.8 shooter in his first nine games of 2014-15.
