LeBron James means business. The four-time MVP signed a two-year deal worth $42.1 million with the Cleveland Cavaliers, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst. Under the terms of the contract, James will also have an opt-out after one year to give him flexibility in an uncertain NBA landscape. Surprised? Don't be. It may seem odd that James, who said in his letter published on SI.com that he wants to retire a Cav, chose to ink a short-term deal with the organization. But the brevity of this deal should be seen as a tactical maneuver to maximize his earning potential, not necessarily an attempt to hold the Cavaliers and its fanbase for ransom.
