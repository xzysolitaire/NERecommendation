LOS ANGELES -- A former intern for the Los Angeles Clippers is accusing the team and its owners, the Sterling Family Trust, of violating labor laws by not paying its interns. In a federal class action lawsuit filed Tuesday, former intern Frank Cooper says he was never paid although he worked 40 to 50 hours per week. For two months in 2012, Cooper worked in the NBA team's fan relations department, where he made calls to season-ticket holders and helped organize basketball clinics. The lawsuit seeks back pay, damages, and attorney's fees for Cooper and other Clippers interns, according to his lawyer, Maurice Pianko. Attorneys for Donald and Shelly Sterling didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
