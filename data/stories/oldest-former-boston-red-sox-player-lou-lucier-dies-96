BOSTON -- Lou Lucier, who was the oldest surviving former Red Sox player, has died at the age of 96. The team says Lucier had a stroke earlier this month and died on Saturday. A right-handed pitcher, Lucier played parts of three major league seasons during World War II with the Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies. In all, he was 3-5 with a 3.81 ERA in 33 games. A native of Northbridge, Massachusetts, he is survived by two daughters, five grandchildren, 13 great grandchildren, and one great-great granddaughter. Lucier was 15 days older than Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr, who is now the oldest living former Red Sox player.
