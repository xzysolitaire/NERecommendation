TUCSON, Ariz. -- Former University of Arizona basketball star Steve Kerr and his wife have pledged $1 million toward the ongoing renovation of McKale Center and future academic facility enhancements. The renovation will impact all 20 of the Tucson school's sports programs, but specifically men's and women's basketball, volleyball and gymnastics, which use McKale as their competition site. Renovations are expected to be completed by the start of the basketball season. The first aspect of the renovation project was completed earlier this year with the installation of a high-definition scoreboard. Kerr now is head coach of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and previously was the Phoenix Suns' general manager from 2007-10. His wife, Margot, also is an Arizona alum.
