You have to hand it to Kentucky coach John Calipari: He sure knows how to put on a show. Approximately 90 NBA scouts and executives piled into Kentucky's practice facility this weekend for what Calipari deemed a "pro day," a Kentucky-only mini-draft combine. Only Kentucky could pull off such a turnout. This edition of the Wildcats is the most talented team Calipari has ever coached, from an NBA prospect perspective. I currently have nine Wildcats ranked in my top 100, by far the most of any team in the country. One of those players, Karl-Anthony Towns, looks like a potential No. 1 pick. All nine players scouts came to see have enough potential to be first-round picks. That's almost one-third of the first round. With so much talent on board, Calipari will be in for quite a juggling act this season when it comes to distributing minutes. He's saying that he'll employ two five-man units in a platoon system this year.
