LOS ANGELES --The Los Angeles Clippers lost their third assistant coach in one week after Tyronn Lue joined the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday as an associate head coach. The Clippers are now shifting their attention toward adding at least one former head coach to their staff. Lawrence Frank, who was an assistant coach under Doc Rivers with the Boston Celtics during the 2010-11 season, is a leading candidate to join the Clippers, sources told ESPNLosAngeles.com. Frank had a public falling out with Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd last season while serving as an assistant. He was previously a head coach with the Detroit Pistons and New Jersey Nets. With the Clippers looking to add at least two assistant coaches this offseason, other names that have been talked about include former New York Knicks coach Mike Woodson, former Pistons coach Maurice Cheeks and Tony Brown, who was an assistant coach under Rivers with the Celtics from 2004 to '07. Last week, Clippers associate head coach Alvin Gentry left for the same position with the Golden State Warriors, while assistant coach Kevin Eastman was promoted to vice president of basketball operations. Eastman's promotion had been in the works for some time. In addition, there was a feeling within the organization that Gentry and Lue would get either head-coaching jobs or significant raises and promotions elsewhere, so their departures did not come as a big surprise to Rivers.
