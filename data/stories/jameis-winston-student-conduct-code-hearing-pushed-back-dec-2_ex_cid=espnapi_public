Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston's upcoming student conduct code hearing has been delayed one day to Dec. 2. Scheduling conflicts have pushed back the hearing, which will determine whether Winston violated the student conduct code in a 2012 incident that led to allegations of sexual assault. The hearing will now take place three days after No. 2 Florida State closes the regular season against rival Florida at Doak Campbell Stadium. Retired Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Major Harding will hear the case. Harding will hear the evidence and decide what, if any, his punishment will be, which could range from a written or verbal reprimand to expulsion.
