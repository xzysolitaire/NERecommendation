Joel Embiid arrived in Cleveland on Tuesday and will work out for the Cavaliers and undergo a medical evaluation that will likely determine whether the franchise takes him with the top overall pick in the NBA Draft, multiple sources told ESPN. The 7-foot Cameroon native is the frontunner to be taken by the Cavs, who hold the No. 1 overall pick in the June 26 NBA Draft, according to multiple sources close to the situation. However, it will depend heavily on his medical evaluation by team doctors since he sat out the end of his freshman campaign with what Kansas called a stress fracture in his lower back. Embiid, who averaged 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks this past season, missed the Big 12 and NCAA tournament due to the back injury and did not attend the Chicago Combine last month. However, he did participate in a 1-on-0 workout for NBA teams in Santa Monica, California in late-May. Embiid's teammate, Andrew Wiggins, and Jabari Parker are also in the mix for the top overall pick, sources told ESPN. "The next day will be huge for him [Embiid] and whether he'll go number one," one source told ESPN. Wiggins will work out for the Milwaukee Bucks, who hold the No. 2 overall pick, Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., a source told ESPN. The Philadelphia 76ers will pick third.
