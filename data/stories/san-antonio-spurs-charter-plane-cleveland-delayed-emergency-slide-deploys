SAN ANTONIO -- An emergency slide accidentally deployed on the San Antonio Spurs charter plane and delayed the team's flight to Cleveland to face the Cavaliers on Wednesday night. KSAT-TV reported Tuesday's incident involved a Delta Air Lines jet on the ground. The slide deployed from the side used by service vendors. The incident delayed the Spurs' departure by about four hours as Delta provided a replacement plane. The teams play at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday.
