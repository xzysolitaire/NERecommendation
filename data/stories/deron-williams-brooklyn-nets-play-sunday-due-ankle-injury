NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets point guard Deron Williams told ESPNNewYork.com that he will not play in Sunday afternoon's game against the Detroit Pistons due to a sprained left ankle. "No. Definitely not tomorrow," said Williams, who was feeding Thanksgiving dinner to families in Brooklyn at an event for his Point of Hope foundation. Center Brook Lopez, reserve forward Andrei Kirilenko and reserve guard Jason Terry will also miss the game with injuries. Williams is unsure when he'll return to the lineup. The three-time All-Star has missed three of Brooklyn's last four games because of the injury. Lopez will miss his fifth straight game with a sprained left ankle.Â  Kirilenko (back spasms) will miss his eighth straight game. He recently received an epidural injection, and hopes to be cleared for contact next week. Terry (bruised left knee) will miss his second straight game.
