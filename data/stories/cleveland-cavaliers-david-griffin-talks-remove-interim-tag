The Cleveland Cavaliers have started negotiations with David Griffin to make him their permanent general manager, sources told ESPN.com. Griffin has been the team's acting general manager since February when he took over after Chris Grant was fired. The Cavs have conducted a secretive search in the last several weeks and interviewed multiple candidates over the last two weeks. Griffin, who was considered a leading candidate for the job at the end of the regular season, had his formal interview earlier this week in Detroit where team owner Dan Gilbert is based, sources said. The Cleveland Plain Dealer first reported the Cavs were moving toward hiring Griffin. Griffin was an executive with the Phoenix Suns for 17 years before coming to the Cavs for a front-office position in 2010. After taking over, he made a trade to acquire center Spencer Hawes at the trade deadline, a move that helped the team contend for the playoffs. The Cavs are headed for a pivotal summer. They own a lottery pick and have free agents Luol Deng and Hawes to deal with. In addition, All-Star Kyrie Irving is eligible to sign a contract extension in July.
