Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports On Friday night, the Golden State Warriors announced an extension to center Andrew Bogut's contract. Instead of becoming an unrestricted free agent in summer 2014, Bogut will instead make at least $36 million over the next three seasons (an average of $12 million per season), with the possibility of making as much as $42 million ($14 million annually) with incentives. The Bogut deal is especially interesting because of the risk both sides took in agreeing to a contract now rather than letting Bogut play out the final season of his contract and having his value set by the market as an unrestricted free agent.
