Illustrated Big Man Archetypes Heading into the 2014-15 NBA season, we forecast the Cleveland Cavaliers to post a historic level of offensive efficiency. What else would a projection system say about a team that signed the league's best player in LeBron James, traded for a top-10 player in Kevin Love and teamed them with emerging star in Kyrie Irving? Yet it's also an unfair forecast. There is nowhere to go but down from there. Cleveland's ninth-ranked offense has been solid despite some well-publicized bumps, especially in the ball-movement category. Yet it's not nearly what we thought the Cavs' offense would be, and not nearly what it will likely become. The attack has been well-above league average when the "big three" have shared the floor, averaging nine points per 100 possessions better than the league average. If that sounds awesome, it's really not. According to NBA.com, among the 250 threesomes to play the most minutes so far this season, 57 have a better offensive efficiency than Irving, James and Love. Power trios like this are supposed to be the tide that lifts their teammates' proverbial boats, but the Cavs' three has just been treading water. The early issues between Irving and James have gotten a lot of attention, but the player who has seen the biggest shift in his accustomed role has been Love. And if the Cleveland offensive rating is to soar to levels that can offset an iffy defense, the team must get more out of Love. How? The answers are simple, but the execution is complex. Love needs to be more assertive. At the same time, he needs to be put in better position to do more damage.
