The biggest NBA prospect in the country has been developing in relative obscurity with the UC Irvine Anteaters, but if Mamadou Ndiaye continues to play like he did in Thursday's upset win over the Washington Huskies, he'll soon be a household name. At 7-foot-6, the freshman from Senegal is believed to be the tallest player currently active in the U.S. He dwarfs Rudy Gobert, the Utah Jazz rookie who was drafted in the first round largely on the strength of his size. Gobert, who is listed at 7-2, recorded a record 7-foot-8½ wingspan at last spring's NBA draft combine. Ndiaye blows that away -- his wingspan was measured at an incredible 8-1 at the 2012 Amar'e Stoudemire Skills Academy. Tools like that are enough to make Ndiaye a game-changing presence with just a few weeks of high-level experience. After two quiet outings to start his career, he powered Irvine's win over a Pac-12 opponent with a near triple-double: 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting to go with eight rebounds and nine blocks in 26 minutes.
