MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. -- A Michigan man who has a rare genetic disorder that affects his facial features is suing former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal and two others for mocking a selfie he posted online. Jahmel Binion filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Macomb County Circuit Court seeking more than $25,000 in damages. The Detroit Free Press says Binion took a picture of himself last summer, and it later was mocked by O'Neal on Instagram and Twitter. A number of others mocked it online as well. According to The Macomb Daily, Binion has hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which is characterized by a reduced ability to sweat, sparse hair growth, missing teeth and facial deformities. Upon learning about Binion's condition, O'Neal apologized in April.
