The Utah Jazz are closing in on a deal to sign free-agent guard Toure' Murry away from the New York Knicks, according to NBA front-office sources. Sources told ESPN.com that the Jazz are finalizing a two-year, $2 million contract with Murry. The Knicks, sources say, have been trying this month to convince Murry to hold off on signing elsewhere as they try continue to sort out their roster, with New York hopeful of bringing back the athletic combo guard after allowing Murry to become an unrestricted free agent at end the June. The Miami Heat were another reported suitor for Murry and the Los Angeles Lakers, sources said, expressed interest in Murry this week before the Jazz secured a commitment from the 24-year-old. Murry averaged a mere 2.7 points and 1.0 assists in 7.3 minutes per game last season but showed promising flashes in 2013's summer league with the Knicks as well as the final two games of New York's 2013-14 campaign, averaging 12.5 points and 3.5 assists in 25.5 minutes per game in those two appearances.
