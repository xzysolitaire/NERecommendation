SYDNEY -- Utah Jazz draft pick Dante Exum is among four NBA players picked for an Australian squad that heads to the FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain next month without injured Andrew Bogut and Patty Mills. NBA championship-winning San Antonio Spurs point guard Mills underwent shoulder surgery this month and isn't expected to play until next season, while Golden State Warriors center Bogut ruled himself ineligible as he recovers from a fractured rib. Along with Exum, Australia coach Andrej Lemanis included NBA players Aron Baynes of the Spurs, point guard Matthew Dellavedova of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cameron Bairstow, who was drafted by the Chicago Bulls last month. Also in the 17-man preliminary squad named Tuesday are six players from Australia's National Basketball League and five Europe-based stars.
