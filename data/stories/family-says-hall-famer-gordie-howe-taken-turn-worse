LUBBOCK, Texas -- Gordie Howe's family says the hockey Hall of Famer "has taken a turn for the worse" after suffering another stroke recently. Mark Howe said Sunday his father's most recent stroke occurred about a week ago in Lubbock, where the 86-year-old former Detroit Red Wings star is staying with his daughter. He was at her home last month when an initial stroke caused some impairment. The younger Howe says chronic back pain, advanced stages of dementia and high blood pressure are taking a toll on his bedridden father. He says the family is concentrating on making him as comfortable and pain-free as possible. The man known as "Mr. Hockey" set NHL marks with 801 goals and 1,850 points that held up until Wayne Gretzky surpassed him in the record book.
