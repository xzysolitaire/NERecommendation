Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY SportsWith Kevin Durant and Nick Collison on the court, OKC outscored opponents by 18.1 points/100 possessions. With apologies to the Miami Heat's Big Three, success in the NBA postseason has always been most strongly defined by dynamic duos -- teammates who feed off each other and dominate opponents. Now that starting forward Serge Ibaka is out for their series with the San Antonio Spurs, and probably the remainder of the postseason, the Oklahoma City Thunder will have to rely on the NBA's best pairing to advance to the NBA Finals. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Nope. Try Kevin Durant and Nick Collison.
