TORONTO -- Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan is going to be out an indefinite period with a torn tendon in his left groin. The durable All-Star was injured during the third quarter of Friday night's 106-102 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He was diagnosed with the injury Saturday. DeRozan remained on the court for several minutes before being helped to the dressing room. He originally was diagnosed as having a strain. DeRozan is averaging a team-high 19.4 points, 4.2 rebounds and a team-best 33.6 minutes in 16 games this season for the Raptors, who are off to their best start at 13-3. A steady presence in the lineup, the 25-year-old DeRozan has missed just 11 games over five seasons before this injury. Teammate Amir Johnson said the Raptors will be OK while DeRozan recovers. "One thing about our team, we have guys that can step up and they are definitely going to have to because that's a big scoring load in DeMar," Johnson told reporters, according to the Toronto Sun. "We have guys that can come in and step up for us."
