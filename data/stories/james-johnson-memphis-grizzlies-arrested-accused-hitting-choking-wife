MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Grizzlies forward James Johnson has been arrested for domestic assault and accused of hitting and choking his wife at their home. Johnson was booked into the Shelby County Jail at 4:35 a.m. Saturday and was still there Saturday afternoon. WMC-TV cited a police affidavit that Johnson and his wife had just returned home when Johnson allegedly hit his wife in the face with an open hand before choking her. Johnson left and returned when police arrived and was arrested. The Memphis Police Department did not immediately return several messages from The Associated Press. The Grizzlies released a statement saying they are gathering information and had no further comment. Johnson is scheduled to appear in court Monday. The 16th pick overall in 2009, Memphis signed him from the D-League in December.
