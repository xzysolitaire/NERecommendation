MINNEAPOLIS -- Hennepin County authorities have dropped a felony domestic assault charge against free-agent forward Dante Cunningham. Cunningham was charged in April for allegedly choking his then-girlfriend. Hennepin County prosecutor Mike Freeman made the announcement Monday and said there "is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt" that Cunningham committed the crime.  Cunningham maintained his innocence throughout the process. He told The Associated Press he is "ecstatic and ready to move forward in life." Cunningham spent the past two seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He became a free agent this summer, but several teams told him they would wait for the legal process to play out before considering signing him. He averaged 6.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game the past season.
