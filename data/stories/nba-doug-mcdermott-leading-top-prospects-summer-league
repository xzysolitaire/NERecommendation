LAS VEGAS -- In between sorting out all the post-LeBron free-agent fallout over the weekend, we were able to take in some actual basketball. The 2014 Las Vegas NBA Summer League has already showcased several huge performances by some of the game's top prospects. Of course, we've also seen some highly touted guys deliver a few clunkers. While everything that happens in the summer league should be taken with a grain of salt, it's always interesting to see how rookies perform as they enter the professional ranks and how some of the league's top prospects are (or aren't) developing. To wit, let's run through a few notable performances during the first three days of summer league action. The rookies Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls McDermott struggled with his shot in Chicago's first game Saturday but still impressed in his own way, displaying significant versatility in a variety of offensive roles. McDermott did everything over the weekend, from spotting up to posting up, making plays on kickouts after he put the ball on the floor to succeeding as a ball screener. In addition, his five boards were the second most on the team and his four assists led the Bulls. On Sunday, McDermott flashed the exciting mix of efficiency and scoring potential that Chicago hopes to see on a regular basis, lighting up Denver for 31 points on just 12 shots. The efficiency was, frankly, incredible. Despite attempting nine 3s, McDermott still managed to shoot 12 free throws.
