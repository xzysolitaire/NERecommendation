DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers acquired speedy outfielder Anthony Gose from the Toronto Blue Jays for second base prospect Devon Travis on Wednesday night. One of Detroit's priorities this offseason was to address center field after Austin Jackson was dealt to Seattle last summer. Gose hit only .226 last season in 94 games with the Blue Jays, but the Tigers are hopeful the 24-year-old will fill a need. "Anthony is a true center fielder that can provide us with above-average defense in center field with a good arm," team president Dave Dombrowski said. "He possesses above-average speed and can steal bases at the major league level. He swings the bat from the left side and we feel that he will continue to improve his offensive game." Travis batted .298 with 10 home runs and 52 RBIs in 100 games with Double-A Erie. He was the Tigers' minor league player of the year in 2013. Detroit drafted Travis in the 13th round in 2012. Munenori Kawasaki (.258 average) and Ryan Goins (.188) made the most starts at second base for the Blue Jays last season. The Tigers traded Jackson in the three-team deal that brought David Price to Detroit at the July 31 deadline. That left Rajai Davis, Ezequiel Carrera and Don Kelly to handle center field.
