LeBron James is no longer a masked man. The Miami Heat star said before Sunday's game against the Chicago Bulls that he no longer will wear the mask that had been protecting his broken nose -- despite not being medically cleared to do so. "It's not comfortable," James said. Minus the mask, James still struggled against the Bulls, shooting 8 of 23 from the field for 17 points -- his fewest in more than a month. The Heat lost in overtime, 95-88. James broke his nose Feb. 20 when he was struck in the face by Serge Ibaka as he drove to the basket during the fourth quarter of a win in Oklahoma City. After sitting out the Heat's next game because of the injury, he returned wearing a black mask before having to switch to a clearer version per the NBA's request. In total, James wore the mask for four-plus games -- he removed it in the first quarter of Thursday night's loss to the San Antonio Spurs, in which he made only 6-of-18 shots and committed five turnovers. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, James was supposed to wear the mask for another week.
