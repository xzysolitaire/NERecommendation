So the deed is done. The Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed in principle to trade Kevin Love, the second-best player in franchise history behind Kevin Garnett. After acquiring Love on draft night just over six years ago and helping him develop into one of the 10 best players in the NBA, the Timberwolves are watching him leave without a single playoff appearance to mark his tenure. Whether you think the playoff drought is Love's fault is irrelevant. He's gone. I was against Minnesota trading Love, but if it had to happen, this is the way to do it. By acquiring the past two No. 1 overall picks, as well as Thaddeus Young from the Philadelphia 76ers, the Timberwolves have at least given themselves an outside chance at replacing Love's elite-level value. Eventually. If it happens, you figure the emergent star will be Andrew Wiggins, but Anthony Bennett is young and talented enough to also develop into a capable starter, his abhorrent rookie season notwithstanding. So where do the Wolves go from here? Here's a look at why Minnesota needs to build up -- not tear down -- and how the club can begin to do so.
