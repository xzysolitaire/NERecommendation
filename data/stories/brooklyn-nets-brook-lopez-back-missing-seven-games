Brooklyn Nets center Brook Lopez will play in Friday night's game against the Houston Rockets at Toyota Center. Power forward Kevin Garnett (rest) will not play. Lopez will not play more than 24 minutes, Nets coach Jason Kidd told reporters in Houston. Lopez has missed the last seven games due to a sprained left ankle injury, which he suffered Nov. 15 in Phoenix. The 25-year-old is averaging 20.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks this season. Meanwhile, point guard Deron Williams did not travel with the team to Houston and will miss at least the next two games. He will be re-evaluated Monday, the team said. Williams has missed six of the team's last seven games because of a sprained left ankle. Forward Andrei Kirilenko and guard Jason Terry are also not on the trip and both players will be out at least another week, the team said. Kirilenko has missed 11 games due to back spasms, while Terry has missed four games due to a bruised left knee.
