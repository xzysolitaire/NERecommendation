New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton missed Tuesday's 92-86 loss to the Detroit Pistons due to hamstring soreness and a pinched nerve in his hip. Felton injured his hip against San Antonio on Nov. 10 when he was hit on a screen. Kenyon MartinÂ started at power forward for the first time this season alongside Andrea Bargnani at center and Carmelo Anthony at small forward. Beno Udrih started at point guard for the Knicks (3-6). J.R. Smith, who has started the last three games, came off the bench for New York. Felton is considered day to day by the team. He first injured his hamstring in the preseason. Both the hip and hamstring injuries have impacted Felton's performance this season. The veteran point guard is shooting just 37 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the arc. Felton, according to reports, is considering sitting out multiple games to let the injury heal. "I don't want to sit out any games. But if I have to, then I got to do what I got to do, so I'm healthy enough to help this team," Felton told reporters on Tuesday.
