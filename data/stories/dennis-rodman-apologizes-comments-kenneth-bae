PYONGYANG, North Korea -- Dennis Rodman has apologized for comments about captive American missionary Kenneth Bae in an interview with CNN. A day after the former basketball star sang "Happy Birthday" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and led a squad of former NBA players in a friendly game, Rodman issued the apology Thursday through publicist Jules Feiler in an email message to The Associated Press. In the statement, Rodman said: "I want to apologize. I take full responsibility for my actions. It had been a very stressful day. ... I had been drinking. ... I want to first apologize to Kenneth Bae's family. ... I embarrassed a lot of people. I'm very sorry." Rodman has been slammed for not using his influence with Kim to help free Bae, the missionary in poor health who is being confined in the North for "anti-state" crimes. On CNN on Tuesday, Rodman implied Bae was at fault.
