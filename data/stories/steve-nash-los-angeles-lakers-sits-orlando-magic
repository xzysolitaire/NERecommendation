LOS ANGELES -- Lakers guard Steve Nash did not play against the Orlando Magic on Sunday because of nerve root irritation in his right hamstring. Nash tweaked his hamstring late in Los Angeles' 117-107 loss to the Washington Wizards on Friday. It was Nash's first game action since he left the Lakers' 96-79 loss to the Utah Jazz on Feb. 11 at halftime and did not return. Nash's ailment that night was due to discomfort stemming from a collision to his left leg with Chicago's Kirk Hinrich the previous game. The 40-year-old Nash had five points and 11 assists in 19 minutes against Washington. Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni said Nash would likely be ready to return to the lineup Tuesday when L.A. hosts the New York Knicks. "He'll test it and when he's ready to go, he'll go," D'Antoni said. Pau Gasol left the game against the Magic at halftime Sunday because of dizziness and nausea. He registered six points, three assists and two rebounds before spending much of the second half laying down in the trainer's room, according to the Lakers. Gasol was then administered four liters of fluids via an IV, according to the team. "He was real dizzy and just couldn't go," D'Antoni said after the Lakers' 103-94 win over the Magic. Gasol is considered questionable for the Knicks game on Tuesday. D'Antoni said center Chris Kaman, who has not played in the Lakers' last 10 games, will probably start against New York if Gasol cannot play. Gasol took an ambulance from Staples Center to a local hospital after the game, where he will spend Sunday night for precautionary evaluation.
