Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins apologized Friday for an incident that earned him a two-game suspension in 2012. Cousins confronted SpursÂ announcer Sean Elliott on Nov. 9, 2012, after a Kings loss to San Antonio because of comments Cousins found critical. The NBA deemed the encounter hostile and threatening and subsequently penalized Cousins. With the Spurs in Sacramento on Friday, Cousins saw an opportunity to make things right. "What happened between me and Sean the other day was just me being man enough to admit that I was wrong," Cousins said, according to the Sacramento Bee. "I wasn't expecting it to get out. I was hoping it was going to be something between me and him." Elliott found the apology sincere, according to the paper.
