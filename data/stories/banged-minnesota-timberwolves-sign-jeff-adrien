MINNEAPOLIS -- The banged-up Minnesota Timberwolves are going to get a little help. The Timberwolves signed free-agent forward Jeff Adrien on Saturday to add some much-needed depth to a roster decimated by injuries. The NBA granted the Timberwolves a roster exemption so they could expand their roster to 16 players. The Wolves have lost point guard Ricky Rubio, center Nikola Pekovic, shooting guard Kevin Martin and backup big man Ronny Turiaf to long-term injuries this season. Adrien will add some bulk to the frontcourt that has only one healthy center in Gorgui Dieng. Adrien is a 6-foot-8 power forward who averaged 6.8 points and 5.8 rebounds in 53 games with Milwaukee and Charlotte last year. He has worked with Wolves shooting coach Mike Penberthy in the past.
