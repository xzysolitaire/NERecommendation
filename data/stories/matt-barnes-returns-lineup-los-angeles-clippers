LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Matt Barnes will return to the lineup for Monday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves after missing the past three games with a right thigh contusion. Barnes suffered the injury in the second quarter of the Clippers' 137-118 win a week ago against the Houston Rockets when he was kneed by Greg Smith. Barnes tried to play in the second half of that game but was unable to and has received treatment since then. Clippers coach Doc Rivers is still unsure what Barnes will be able to provide after missing most of training camp and the preseason with a calf injury. "Matt's not feeling right," Rivers said. "He's playing tonight, but just because they're playing, it doesn't mean they're healthy, and Matt hasn't played. Matt missed most of training camp and the preseason. He's on the floor but I literally don't know what Matt could give us. It could be good; it could be bad. It's good either way because it's minutes burned that will allow him to get to where he needs to get. I think it's going to take Matt a long time and a while to get a rhythm and everything. I don't think you miss that much and just walk in a game." Clippers forward Jared DudleyÂ had an MRI on his bruised right knee that came back negative and will start. Dudley suffered the injury in August but has been playing through the pain. "We've had a lot of injuries, and I thought I could play without hurting the team," Dudley said. "I feel good so it's more of a day-to-day basis. It was good to mentally know there's nothing wrong with it."
