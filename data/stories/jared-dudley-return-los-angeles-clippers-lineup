LOS ANGELES -- Clippers forward Jared Dudley, who missed the past three games with mid-back spasms, said he will return Wednesday night against the Golden State Warriors. "Yeah, I'll be back tonight," Dudley said. "I could have gone on Monday but it was 85 [percent]. There's no pain, no restrictions. I feel good." Dudley worked out on Tuesday and Wednesday, and he will come off the bench against the Warriors. Dudley has played in 62 games this season, starting in 42, averaging 7.3 points and 2.2 rebounds. Clippers guard Chris Paul injured his groin against the Phoenix Suns on Monday but finished the game and said he would start Wednesday. "It scared me a little bit the other night but we got an unbelievable training staff and they got me through," Paul said. "I will be there [Wednesday]." Fellow guard Jamal Crawford will miss his fifth game in the past six games as he recovers from a left calf strain. Crawford said he's hoping to return Sunday or Monday. Guard J.J. Redick has continued to increase his workout and shooting regimens this week, but there is still no timetable for his return from a bulging disk in his lower back.
