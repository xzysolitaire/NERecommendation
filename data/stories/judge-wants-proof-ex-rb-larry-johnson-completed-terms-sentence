LAS VEGAS -- A Las Vegas judge gave a lawyer until July 30 to produce proof that former NFL running back Larry Johnson met terms of his sentence following his conviction in a domestic violence case involving an ex-girlfriend at a Las Vegas Strip resort. Attorney Gregory Knapp appeared in court for Johnson on Thursday, and said later that he'll provide paperwork showing the 34-year-old former Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins star has completed required community service and counseling. Johnson was sentenced to probation, 48 hours of community service and six months of counseling after pleading no contest in July 2013 to misdemeanor battery and assault. Knapp says Johnson lives in Florida. He was arrested in October 2012 at the Bellagio after he was accused of beating and choking the 32-year-old woman.
