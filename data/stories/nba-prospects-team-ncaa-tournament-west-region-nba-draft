South | Midwest | East | West This year, the talent in the West Region is a little better than some might think. Three players are considered potential lottery picks and three others look like possible selections later in the first round. Furthermore, there are hidden gems in this region. Insider's NBA draft team has talked to multiple NBA scouts and general managers during the season, and based on their feedback and information, here's a look at the top NBA prospects for each of the teams in the West Region, listed as potential lottery picks, first-rounders, second-rounders and "wait until next year" players. (Teams listed by seed.) 1. Arizona Wildcats Lottery pick: Aaron Gordon, F, freshman Potential first-rounder: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, G/F, freshman Potential second-rounders: Brandon Ashley, F, sophomore; Nick Johnson, SG, junior Wait until next year: Kaleb Tarczewski, C, sophomore Gordon doesn't put up big offensive numbers, but when you watch him play, it's easy to see that he's a huge catalyst for this Arizona team. His defensive intensity, athletic abilities and motor are elite, and he does just enough offensively to make him worth a top-10 pick. Hollis-Jefferson isn't a big-time scorer, either, but he also brings a package of athleticism, toughness and energy to the table that scouts love in a potential first-round pick.
