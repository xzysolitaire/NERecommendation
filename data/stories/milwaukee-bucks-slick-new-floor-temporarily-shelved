MILWAUKEE -- The Bucks' slick new home floor has been temporarily shelved. The team announced Wednesday night the court used for the 2012-13 season will be in place for at least the first few weeks of the season, including the home opener Saturday against Toronto. It will replace a new floor that had been installed for this season. But the NBA decided that floor needs to be resurfaced after players slipped during last week's exhibition game, also against the Raptors. The conditions led to officials calling off that game midway through the first quarter. League and team officials inspected the floor at the Bradley Center this week. The team says the refinishing job is expected to take no more than three weeks. Milwaukee opened the season Wednesday night in New York against the Knicks.
