One of the first important calendar dates during every NBA regular season is the last day in October. That's the date by which teams must come to terms on contract extensions for fourth-year players working on first-round contracts. Failure to do so doesn't prohibit a team from signing the player after the season, when he can become a restricted free agent, but it does cast both player and team into limbo. If you know you want to keep a guy anyway, then it's usually better to move fast. (Larry Sanders notwithstanding.) This year, one of the most intriguing extension candidates is Golden State's Klay Thompson. Thompson wants max money. The Warriors probably would prefer not to pay him that since, among other things, they've already got four eight-figure salaries on the books through next season. Regardless, the Warriors will probably cave and give Thompson and his agent what they want. After Golden State reportedly passed on a chance to obtain Kevin Love this summer, which would have cost the team Thompson, the Warriors have cast their lot with the "Splash Brothers" backcourt of Thompson and Stephen Curry. It's also commonly believed that Thompson would garner a max offer sheet if he does hit the restricted market. After the deals landed this past summer by Gordon Hayward and Eric Bledsoe, that's probably true. That being the case, if the Warriors plan to keep Thompson, they might as well cough up the dough. Let's cut to the chase: By my metrics, Thompson is not worth a max contract, or anything close to it.
