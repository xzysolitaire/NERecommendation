Hornets forward Jeff Taylor won't appeal his 24-game suspension resulting from a domestic abuse incident, sources told ESPN and multiple media outlets, despite the fact National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts called the ban "excessive, without precedent and a violation of the collective bargaining agreement" a day earlier. Taylor is expected to make an announcement on an appeal Friday. NBA commissioner Adam Silver suspended Taylor for 24 games without pay Wednesday after the forward pleaded guilty last month to misdemeanor domestic violence assault and malicious destruction of hotel property. Taylor will lose nearly $200,000 of his $915,000 salary. He will get credit for the 11 games he has missed and will sit out an additional 13 for a total that is slightly more than one-fourth of the league's 82-game schedule. Roberts said the union was eager to challenge the NBA on the severity of the suspension based on the league's collective bargaining agreement. "The CBA contemplates a minimum 10-game suspension in any case involving a conviction for a violent felony, including domestic violence," Roberts' statement read. "In contrast, Jeff Taylor was charged with a misdemeanor that is likely to be dismissed at the end of a probationary period."
