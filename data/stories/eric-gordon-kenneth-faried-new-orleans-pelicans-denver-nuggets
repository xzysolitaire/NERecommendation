NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans shooting guard Eric Gordon is sitting out Friday night's game against Denver because of a right hip contusion. He was hurt in New Orleans' previous game Monday night. Meanwhile, Denver forward Kenneth Faried is missing his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. Gordon was knocked hard to the floor by Scaramento's Isaiah Thomas while trying to convert a layup in the Pelicans' 113-100 victory over the Kings. Pelicans coach Monty Williams says Anthony Morrow is starting for Gordon so guard Tyreke Evans can remain one of the first players off the bench. With Faried out, Denver coach Brian Shaw says he's starting Timofey Mozgov at center, moving J.J. Hickson to power forward and starting Jordan Hamilton at shooting guard in place of a healthy Randy Foye.
