OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors backup center Jermaine O'Neal is scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery on his right wrist Friday. The team said a timetable for O'Neal's return will be announced following the procedure, which threatens to end his season -- and possibly his career. The 35-year-old O'Neal is in his 18th NBA season and has had previous knee and wrist surgeries. The Warriors said O'Neal's latest operation is "to address a torn ligament in his right wrist." O'Neal has appeared in 17 games this season, averaging 6.2 points, 4.5 rebounds and 18.6 minutes. He's the third reserve center for Golden State to have surgery this year. Festus Ezeli is expected to be out until at least late January while he recovers from right knee surgery. And Ognjen Kuzmic will be sidelined at least another four weeks after fracturing a bone in his right hand.
