INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Pacers made it official Wednesday: Andrew Bynum's season is over. About seven hours before facing Washington in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, team officials said the oft-injured Bynum would miss the rest of the playoffs and would not even be with the team for the rest of the postseason. Indiana lost Game 1 on Monday in the best-of-seven series. Bynum had been battling a sore right knee even before he signed with the team Feb. 1 from Cleveland. The Pacers hoped he could add depth behind All-Star center Roy Hibbert. Bynum looked good in his Pacers debut, but he played only one more game, finishing the season with averages of 11.5 points and 9.5 rebounds in 26 games overall.
