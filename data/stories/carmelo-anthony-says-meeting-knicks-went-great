New York -- Carmelo Anthony said he had a "great" meeting with Knicks president Phil Jackson, general manager Steve Mills and head coach Derek Fisher in Los Angeles last week. He also commended Jackson for his decision to hire Fisher, a first-year head coach. "It was great meeting with Phil, it went well," Anthony told two reporters at an event on Wednesday in Manhattan to promote his partnership with 50 Cent and SMS Audio headphones. On Fisher's hiring, Anthony added: "I like what Phil is doing." Anthony met with Jackson, Fisher and Mills in Los Angeles last Friday to discuss his pending free agency. Anthony has said throughout the season that he plans to opt out of the final year of his contract and test free agency this summer. Jackson has said publicly, though, that he'd like Anthony to opt in to the final year of his deal with the Knicks and become a free agent next summer. A source close to Anthony said late last week that Anthony hadn't changed his mind on free agency and still plans to opt out and become a free agent this summer. Anthony, according to sources, has until June 23 to inform the Knicks if he plans to opt out of his contract. The All Star forward politely declined to discuss his future on Wednesday night. He said he is spending the majority of his offseason in Los Angeles. The Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks are all teams Anthony would consider in free agency, sources told ESPN.com's Marc Stein. Free agency begins July 1. Miami Heat officials have also started to explore their options in trying to create enough financial flexibility to land Anthony in free agency, ESPN.com reported last week. Anthony can sign a maximum contract for $129 million over five years with the Knicks. If he signs with another team, Anthony can sign a maximum contract of $96 million over four years.
