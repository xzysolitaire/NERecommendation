If the excitement surroundingÂ Derrick Rose's performance at the Team USA training camp in Las Vegas turns out to be warranted, his return to prominence could prove to be the biggest news of the Chicago Bulls' offseason. Indeed, any hopes that Chicago has for climbing back into contention are contingent upon Rose returning to his All-Star form. There's a long time to go between now and the regular season, but there could be no better late-summer news for Bulls fans than the hyperbole regarding Rose's practice form. A healthy Rose brings the Chicago roster into focus, and it's one that is a little more balanced and every bit as deep as the version the Bulls fielded during Rose's MVP season in 2010-11. However, it's not a perfect roster. It still has holes. Here are six title contenders -- including the Bulls -- that still have glaring holes on their rosters. How will they fill them? Who's the best fit?
