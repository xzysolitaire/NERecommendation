RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- Kyrie Irving suffered a right ankle injury during practice before the Cleveland Cavaliers traveled to Brazil for their preseason game with the Miami Heat. Irving had X-rays taken, and he underwent an MRI on Tuesday before the team charter left. Both tests were negative, and he's considered day-to-day. His status for Saturday's preseason game is uncertain. Irving was using a walking boot as he left with teammates for sightseeing on the team's day off. Irving tweeted Wednesday afternoon that his injury wasn't serious. Irving has missed 49 games with injuries over the past three seasons. He led the Cavs with 16 points in their first preseason game this past weekend against Maccabi Tel Aviv.
