AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Greg Monroe says he is looking forward to playing for Stan Van Gundy after signing a qualifying offer to stay with the Detroit Pistons. Van Gundy took over as Detroit's coach and team president this offseason, and the Pistons were unable to sign Monroe to a long-term contract. They officially announced Monday that the restricted free agent had signed the team's $5.48 million, one-year qualifying offer. "I look forward to playing for Coach Van Gundy and his staff," Monroe said. "He has a proven track record and I'm excited about working with my teammates to get better and prepare for the season." By signing the qualifying offer, Monroe sets himself up to become an unrestricted free agent after this season. Van Gundy said he respects Monroe's decision. The 24-year-old Monroe has been a consistent scorer for the Pistons since they drafted him with the seventh pick in 2010.Â He averaged 15.2 points and 9.3 rebounds in 2013-14 -- numbers almost identical to what he posted during the previous two seasons. He's shot 51 percent from the field over the course of his career.
