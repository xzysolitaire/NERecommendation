OKLAHOMA CITY -- San Antonio Spurs reserve guard Manu Ginobili sat out Thursday night's showdown against Oklahoma City, while Thunder center Kendrick Perkins returned to action. When asked during pregame whether Ginobili, who has missed 12 games this season, was sitting because of an injury or to rest, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich simply said: "He's out." Ginobili, who averages 12.3 points and 4.4 assists per game, is not listed on the injury report. The Spurs played Golden State on Wednesday night, extending their winning streak to 19 games. Perkins, a defensive enforcer at 6-foot-10 and 270 pounds, has missed the past 17 games with a left groin strain he suffered against the Miami Heat. He averages 3.4 points and 5.0 rebounds in just under 20 minutes per game.
