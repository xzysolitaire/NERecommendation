LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul strained his right hamstring in the third quarter of the Clippers' 93-80 win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night and did not return to the game. Paul was cleared by trainers to return to the game late in the fourth quarter, and he said he would play in the Clippers' next game Friday against the Sacramento Kings. "I think he's doing good," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "[Clippers trainer Jasen Powell] said he could have come back in but there was no chance he was coming back in. Chris has told me already twice that he'll be ready for Friday but that doesn't mean that that's true. That's just what he said." Paul, who had 15 points and seven assists in 26 minutes, left the game with 3:19 remaining in the third quarter and went back to the locker room. He returned to the Clippers' bench late in the fourth quarter with his right hamstring heavily taped. At that point, the Clippers had taken a commanding lead and there was no need for him to reenter the game. "I just strained my hamstring a little bit but I'm all right," Paul said. "I went to the back and I was on the bike watching the game. I came back and I told Doc if you need me I can go. It's a little tight but I'll be ready Friday."
