Carmelo Anthony had 11 free throw attempts in the New York Knicks' 109-106 loss to the Houston RocketsÂ on Thursday night. James Harden had 18. That didn't sit well with Anthony, who expressed frustration with calls referees made -- or didn't make. "You look at that and you see the way that some guys get their calls; me, I got to get cut, you've got to see blood for me to get a call down there," Anthony said after the Knicks' loss. "That's where the frustration comes from." Anthony was asked after the game whether Harden had forced his way to the line so frequently with aggressive drives to the paint. But he disagreed with that theory, seemingly taking a shot at the officials. "We didn't put him on the line. They put him on the line," Anthony said. " ... Harden is a tough guy to guard, especially when they're calling the game the way that they called it tonight. Tough thing to guard out there." For the game, the Rockets were 38-of-44 from the free throw line. The Knicks took 27, making 22. Harden led the NBA in free throw attempts last season and is third this season. He was 16-of-18 on Thursday, while Anthony, his teammate on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, was 9-for-11.
