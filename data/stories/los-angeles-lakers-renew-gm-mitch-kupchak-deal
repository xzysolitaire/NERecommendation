LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to a multiyear extension with general manager Mitch Kupchak. The Lakers, in response to an ESPN.com report earlier Tuesday night, confirmed the new deal for Kupchak to reporters late in the fourth quarter of a 145-130 loss to the Houston Rockets. Kupchak has presided over four NBA championships since succeeding Jerry West as the Lakers' general manager in 2000. He has been with the organization since retiring as a player in 1986. Details of Kupchak's current contract have never been released, but he had one year remaining on his current deal. With the Lakers in the midst of the worst season in franchise history, the extension for Kupchak solidifies his decision-making role and is a reflection of the esteem in which he is held by the Buss family. The timing of the extension is also effectively a vote of confidence to reflect the Buss family's trust in him to shape the future of the organization, sources said. The Lakers' latest defeat was their 53rd of the season, matching the franchise record set in 1958. Kupchak has a wholesale rebuilding job in store with the Lakers, who will miss the playoffs for just the third time since 1976.
