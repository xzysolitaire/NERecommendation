NEW ORLEANS -- Sacramento Kings forward Rudy Gay and guard Darren Collison missed Tuesday night's 99-89 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Gay missed his first game since injuring his right Achilles tendon on Nov. 15. Collison has a left quadriceps injury. Kings coach Michael Malone said Gay's injury bothered the forward enough that the team will likely rest him for a couple of days before evaluating his progress. Gay is averaging 21.1 points and 6.5 rebounds for the Kings (8-5). Collison is averaging 15.9 points and leads the team with 84 assists. Forward Omri Casspi, who started in place of Gay, scored 22 points, while guard Ramon Sessions had 15 points and six assists starting in place of Collison.
