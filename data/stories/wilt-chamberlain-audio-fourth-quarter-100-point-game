The death of Philadelphia radio and TV sports announcer Bill Campbell this week brought back fond recollections of Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point performance for the Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962. The YouTube clip below is Campbell's radio broadcast of the fourth quarter. No video of the night's action is known to exist. Shortly before Wilt sank the three-digit hoop, Campbell observed of Wilt's night, "That's a lot of points if you're playing grammar school kids, isn't it?"
