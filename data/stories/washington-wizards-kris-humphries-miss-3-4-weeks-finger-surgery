WASHINGTON -- Wizards forward Kris Humphries is expected to miss three to four weeks of basketball activity after having surgery for nerve damage in his right pinky finger. Humphries, acquired from the Celtics in a trade in July, cut his right hand on the rim during Washington's preseason game against the Chicago Bulls on Monday. Humphries averaged 8.4 points and 5.9 rebounds last season.
