With the college basketball season about to get underway, it's time to take a preseason look at the top NBA draft prospects by position. First we took a look at the bigs, then the wings. The point guard group is the weakest position in the draft this season; there's only one sure-fire lottery pick in the group. We are projecting just five point guards to be taken in the first round next summer.

Expect them to change as the season progresses. We aim to come back each month with an update. Here are the top 10 point guard prospects for 2015, along with some others to watch: 1.
