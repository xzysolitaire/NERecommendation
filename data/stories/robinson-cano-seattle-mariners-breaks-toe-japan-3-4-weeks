Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano suffered a non-displaced fracture of his right small toe when he was hit in the foot with a pitch during baseball's Japan All-Star Series, the Mariners announced Saturday. The injury will not require a cast or treatment, but Cano will have to refrain from baseball activities for 3-4 weeks while the fracture heals, Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik said in a statement. Cano, part of a Major League Baseball All-Star team touring Japan this month, suffered the injury when he was struck in the foot by Samurai Japan pitcher Yuki Nishi in the seventh inning of Japan's 4-0 no-hit victory Saturday. Cano will not take part in the remainder of the All-Star Series. Cano, a six-time All-Star and .310 career hitter, signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with Seattle last December. He hit .314 with an .836 OPS in his first season with the Mariners and finished fifth in American League MVP balloting behind Mike Trout, Victor Martinez, Michael Brantley and Jose Abreu.
