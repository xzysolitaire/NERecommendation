The Texas Rangers have three finalists for their vacant managerial position. They are Pittsburgh Pirates bench coach Jeff Banister, Rangers interim manager Tim Bogar and Cleveland Indians bullpen coach Kevin Cash. Rangers GM Jon Daniels said before the ending of the regular season he wanted to get a new manager in place inside October, but an announcement can't be made during the World Series. Bogar, who took over for Ron Washington, who resigned in September, appears to be the favorite. He was hired last offseason to become Washington's bench coach and be groomed to become a manager, if not with the Rangers, then somewhere else. Bogar had interviewed with the Arizona Diamondbacks for their managerial position last week. The team hired Chip Hale on Monday. Banister is highly thought of in baseball circles, and he decided against managing in the Arizona Fall League during this interview process. "All I can say for now, out of respect to [Daniels] and his entire staff, it's still an ongoing process," Banister said to MLB.com. "I did have a tremendous time with them in Texas. That's a great group of baseball men, really passionate about the game. We had a good conversation, and I could tell they love to talk baseball." Cash just completed his second season as the bench coach in Cleveland. The Rangers interviewed eight people for the job, including current pitching coach Mike Maddux and Triple-A manager Steve Buechele.
