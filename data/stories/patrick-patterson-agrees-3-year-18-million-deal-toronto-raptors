The Toronto Raptors have agreed to a three-year, $18 million deal with forward Patrick Patterson, a source close to the situation told ESPN. Patterson, 25, averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in 48 games last season with the Raptors. He was drafted 14th overall by Houston in 2010 and has been traded twice -- to Sacramento in February of 2013 and to Toronto in December of 2013. Toronto also agreed with point guard Kyle Lowry on a four-year, $48 million contract earlier this week.
