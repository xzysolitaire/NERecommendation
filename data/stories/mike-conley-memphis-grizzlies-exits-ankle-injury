MINNEAPOLIS -- Memphis Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley had to be helped to the locker room with a sprained right ankle suffered in the fourth quarter of Friday night's 94-90 win at Minnesota. "I can put weight on it now," Conley said after the game. "Tomorrow is looking iffy, but hopefully after some treatment tonight and the next day we will go from there." Conley will be re-evaluated Saturday before the Grizzlies face the Bucks. He took to Twitter after the game: Conley was hurt when Timberwolves guard J.J. Barea drove to the basket and scored on a twisting layup. Conley went up to challenge the shot and stepped on Barea's foot when he came down. His ankle rolled severely and he couldn't put any weight on it as two teammates helped him off the court. Conley had 12 points on 4-for-14 shooting and eight assists in 30 minutes before he was injured. Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger went with a big backcourt of Courtney Lee and Mike Miller in Conley's absence.
