EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Pau Gasol did not travel with the Los Angeles Lakers to Salt Lake City on Thursday because of an upper respiratory infection. Gasol is officially listed as day to day, meaning he could play against the Utah Jazz on Friday night if he feels improved enough to join the team via commercial flight Friday morning. "Like anything else, you're not 100 percent physically and you're going to have shorter times of energy and stuff like that," Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni said when asked about Gasol. "He'll get over it. He'll be fine." Gasol sat out the Lakers' 102-83 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday with the same condition but had played in L.A.'s last two games, averaging 11.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists in losses to Phoenix and Miami. He did not practice with the Lakers on Thursday, using the time to visit with ear, nose and throat specialist Dr. John J. Rehm. The 13-year veteran is averaging 14.7 points and 9.4 rebounds on 44.6 percent shooting this season.
