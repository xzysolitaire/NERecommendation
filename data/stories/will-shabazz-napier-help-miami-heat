Shabazz Napier Excited To Join Heat Former UConn guard Shabazz Napier talks about his experience being drafted by the Hornets and then traded shortly afterward to the Miami Heat. Tags: NBA, Shabazz Napier, Charlotte Bobcats, Miami Heat Shabazz Napier Excited To Join Heat The Miami Heat finally got their man. No, not LeBron James. The guy James wanted: former UConn Huskies point guard and reigning NCAA champion Shabazz Napier. James' respect for Napier has been well-documented since he tweeted "No way u take another PG in the lottery before Napier" over two months ago, right after the Huskies cut down the nets.
