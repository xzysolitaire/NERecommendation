Illustrated Big Man Archetypes Chris Bosh declared himself dead this summer. Or at least a version of himself -- the Toronto one. "Everybody's like, 'We need CB4,'" Bosh said. "And I'm like, that's dead. He's dead. He's not coming back. This is me. I can't hold on to the past and think I'm going to be who I was back then. It's impossible. Because I'm much better now." That was several months ago, before news hit that LeBron James would head back to Cleveland. That last line about Bosh being better is what he and coach Erik Spoelstra have been repeating ad nauseum since training camp began. While everyone wondered if Bosh could be the so-called Toronto Bosh again in LeBron James' absence, the team internally believed that would set the bar too low. He's better now, they insisted. Hard to disagree with that now.
