The Brooklyn Nets and Paul Westphal have verbally agreed to terms on a deal which will enable the veteran NBA coach to serve as an assistant under Lionel Hollins, a league source confirmed to ESPN NewYork.com. Westphal, 63, has served as a head coach with the Phoenix Suns, Seattle SuperSonics and Sacramento Kings and had plenty of success. In parts of 10 seasons, Westphal has posted a 318-279 record. Westphal took the Suns to the NBA Finals in 1992-93. He coached the Kings from 2009-12 before getting fired seven games into the 2011-12 campaign. Former coach Jason Kidd took several assistants with him from Brooklyn to Milwaukee. Joe Prunty joined Eric Hughes and Sean Sweeney on Kidd's staff Wednesday, a source confirmed to ESPN NewYork.com's Ohm Youngmisuk. Assistants John Welch and Jim Sann are the only members of Kidd's staff still with Brooklyn. Welch and Hollins attended the same high school (Rancho in Las Vegas). Lawrence Frank, who was demoted by Kidd to doing daily reports, remains under contract with the Nets. Frank could leave Brooklyn to join Doc Rivers on the Clippers' bench, ESPN LosAngeles.com's Ramona Shelburne reported in late June.
