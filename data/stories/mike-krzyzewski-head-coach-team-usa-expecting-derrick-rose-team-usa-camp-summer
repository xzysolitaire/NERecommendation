Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose, limited to just 10 games this season due to a torn meniscus in his right knee, will join Team USA for its training camp this summer in preparation for the World Cup of Basketball in Spain, national team coach Mike Krzyzewski said Tuesday. "We expect him to be there that last week of July when we're choosing the team in Vegas," Krzyzewski said during an "ESPNU College Basketball" podcast with host Andy Katz. "He can't make the team unless he's ready to go full bore. And knowing Derrick I would think he'll be ready, and hopefully he'll be 100 percent." Rose suffered his latest knee injury -- he missed the 2012-13 season while recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee -- on Nov. 22. Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said earlier this month that the former league MVP had started taking contact in practice. Krzyzewski and the Team USA staff have a pool of 28 players eligible for the World Cup, to be held Aug. 30 to Sept. 14. Only 12, however, will make the Spain-bound team. LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony already have been ruled out, according to Krzyzewski. The coach said the trio "may be available" for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where each would attempt to win a third gold medal. Deron Williams, who said last week that he may need offseason surgery on both his ankles, is a question mark for the training camp, said Krzyzewski, who also noted that no 2014 NBA draft picks will be at the camp. "It's a fluid group, so you're always waiting to the end of the playoffs to find out contractually, physically, and family-wise who you actually have," Krzyzewski said on the podcast. "It's a very fluid situation. "We're anxious to see once the season ends just who is going to be there. And then hopefully we'll select 12 guys that will win the World Cup for us."
