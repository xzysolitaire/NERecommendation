OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Golden State Warriors were without center Andrew Bogut and power forward David Lee against the New York Knicks. Warriors coach Mark Jackson said before Sunday night's game that an MRI exam on Bogut showed a bruise in his groin and pelvic area, but no structural damage. Bogut was injured in Friday's win over Memphis when Marc Gasol kneed Bogut while attempting a layup. Bogut also is expected to miss Tuesday's game at Dallas and Wednesday's game at San Antonio. Jackson is hopeful Lee could return sooner after missing his second consecutive game with a strained right hamstring. The Warriors signed veteran center Hilton Armstrong to a 10-day contract Sunday to help fortify the frontcourt. He had been playing with the team's NBA Development League affiliate in Santa Cruz.
