Aldon Smith will not face misdemeanor charges stemming from an arrest for allegedly making a fake bomb threat at Los Angeles International Airport in April. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office said Tuesday morning that Smith will not face charges from the April 13 incident following a long review. The star San Francisco 49ers linebacker, however, will have a July 30 hearing to address the situation. A spokesman for the city attorney's office wrote in an email that the hearing's purpose is to provide Smith the opportunity to give his account of the incident. He will then be admonished about the applicable laws and given suggestions on how to avoid similar incidents in the future, the spokesman wrote. The City Attorney reserves the right to file charges up to one year after the incident. However, no further action is scheduled beyond the office hearing date. Although this matter appears to be close to finished, Smith's legal issues are not. He will be sentenced July 25 for pleading no contest to three felony gun charges and could face jail time. The NFL could also suspend him. The 49ers start training camp July 24. Smith has 42 sacks in 43 regular-season games.
