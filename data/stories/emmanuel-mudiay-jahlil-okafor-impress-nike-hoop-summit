PORTLAND, Ore. -- NBA scouts and GMs were out in force last week at the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit, taking in both practices and Saturday's game. Unlike the McDonald's All American Game and Jordan Brand Classic, the Hoop Summit is played more like a real competition than an all-star game. Defense is played, sets are run and the overall atmosphere is more serious, which makes for a better scouting event. Each year, Team USA's Junior Select Team competes against a World Team comprising the top young international players. Team USA beat the World Team 84-73 this time around. The event serves as a good preview of the incoming freshman class for the 2014-15 season and as a proving ground where top international talent can come and make their mark. This year, only one of the players on the floor had a shot at going in the first round in the 2014 draft, Switzerland's Clint Capela. Capela has generated a lot of buzz this year from international scouts. He's a 6-foot-11 bouncy power forward with a huge wingspan who has been putting up solid numbers in France. Many scouts began speaking of him as a potential lottery pick as early as this year. But this event really didn't do him any favors. {C} To see Chad Ford's evaluation of the top players at the Nike Hoop Summit, sign up to become an ESPN Insider today.
