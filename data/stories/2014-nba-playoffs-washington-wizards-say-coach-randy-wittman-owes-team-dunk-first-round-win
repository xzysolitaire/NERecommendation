There's a mini-controversy brewing within the ranks of the Washington Wizards. And coach Randy Wittman is to blame. Wizards players say Wittman promised them a dunk attempt if they beat the Chicago Bulls in the opening round of the playoffs. But more than a week after Washington won the series in five games, the coach has yet to try to go above the rim. "Witt got to be a man of his word," second-year guard Bradley Beal told reporters. "He was supposed to do it last round. He had up until the first game [of the team's second-round series against the Indiana Pacers]Â to dunk. "You know Witt. He needs a couple days to get stretched out. Hopefully he'll do it. I think he can do it. Maybe." Others aren't so sure. The 6-foot-6 Wittman, who played 10 seasons in the NBA, is 54 years old. "You think that's possible? You'd think that's even possible?" forward Drew Gooden said, according to The Washington Post. "I'd like to see that. I'd definitely like to see that." Center Marcin Gortat says Wittman is trying to go back on his word. "Now he's trying to get out of that. He says he's going to touch the rim," Gortat said, according to CSNWashington.com. "That's what he said, which is kind of weird because we said dunk." Even if Wittman doesn't deliver on his promise, Wizards players are unlikely to be too upset. Washington is 4-0 away from home this postseason, making Wittman only the third coach to win his first four road playoff games. Pat Riley (1982) and Mike Dunleavy (1991) did it with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Wizards can make it 5-0 on the road when they return to Bankers Life Fieldhouse for Game 2 on Wednesday night.
