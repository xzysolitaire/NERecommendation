INDIANAPOLIS -- Police have arrested a man in connection with the April burglary at the Indianapolis home of Indiana Pacers star Paul George. Indianapolis police say 43-year-old Michael Lewis of Whitestown was arrested Wednesday on burglary and theft charges for the April 28 break-in during which George's platinum All-Star ring, valued at $15,000, was taken. Police say detectives believe the burglary was a random act and that Lewis didn't specifically target George's home, which is on the city's northeast side. George's parents discovered the burglary when they returned from a Pacers playoff game. It occurred between 7:15 p.m. and 11:45 p.m. ET, according to the police report. Among other items reported stolen was a $700 watch. Police say none of the stolen items have been recovered. Lewis was jailed Wednesday morning. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney.
