DALLAS -- Pau Gasol remains with the Los Angeles Lakers after the Cleveland Cavaliers instead chose to deal Andrew Bynum and a package of draft picks to the Chicago Bulls for Luol Deng late Monday. Tuesday morning was business as usual for the Lakers, who held a shootaround in advance of their game against the Mavericks. Gasol, 33, may be used to hearing his name connected with trades. But it's never comfortable. And this was a new experience altogether for his teammates, most of whom were not here last season. "I'm pretty sure it'll come back up. That's what comes with being a Laker," forward Nick Young said. "We're still getting used to it, but we'll be OK." Young said players were happy Gasol wasn't traded because of what it signaled to the team about management's faith in the rest of the season. "Yeah, that's one thing you were thinking about," Young said. "If they get rid of Pau, it's basically saying it's over. But we all feel that faith and still think something can happen." The Lakers fell to 14-20 with a 137-115 loss Sunday to the Denver Nuggets. They face the Mavericks -- losers of their previous four home games -- Tuesday and travel to Houston on Wednesday. The Rockets may be without sharp-shooting forward Chandler Parsons, who injured his knee at practice Monday. "Every day we have the records and the standings up on the board," Young said. "We know we're not that far off. We wish we had those games against 76ers, Milwaukee, all those games back, because those were ones we really needed. But it is what it is, we still gotta focus on Dallas and Houston now." Gasol has been outstanding in the three games he has played since returning from an upper respiratory infection. The Lakers nominated him for Western Conference Player of the Week on Monday after he averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds 4.7 assists and 3.3 blocks in three games last week. "I guess he's got to hear more rumors like that all the time," Young joked. "I want to see that Pau every day."
