EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Xavier Henry continues to have issues with his surgically repaired right knee and will miss the team's final four preseason games while seeking further medical treatment, the team announced Saturday. In the coming days, the 23-year-old will travel to New York City to see Dr. Keith Pyne for a second opinion. Then Henry will travel to Dusseldorf, Germany, to receive Regenokine treatment from Dr. Jens Hartmann. Kobe Bryant has had similar Regonkine treatments several times in his career. The noninvasive procedure involves blood being removed from his knee and spun in a centrifuge before doctors create a serum that is then injected back in the knee to fight off proteins and molecules that cause inflammation. The Lakers estimate that Henry, who averaged 10 points and 2.7 rebounds in 43 games last season, will return to the team Oct. 24, four days before their regular-season opener against the Houston Rockets at Staples Center. Henry injured his knee last December, forcing him to miss most of last season. He had surgery in April, but apparently a full offseason of recovery hasn't helped.
