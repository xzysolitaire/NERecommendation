LAS VEGAS -- Miami Heat rookie Shabazz Napier disavowed any knowledge that his Twitter account unfollowed LeBron James and deleted a series of tweets following James' decision to join the Cleveland Cavaliers. "The whole thing about that is I don't know how to work Twitter yet and I'm not on my Twitter, so I don't know where that came from," Napier said after the Heat's 85-83 loss to the Washington Wizards at Las Vegas Summer League. Napier joined Twitter on June 25, a day before the Heat drafted him. He followed James shortly thereafter. But days after James decided to return to Cleveland, the point guard's account, @ShabazzNapier, no longer follows James' account, @KingJames, and any tweets sent toward James have been removed. "I don't pay attention to it," Napier said. "It gets brought to me by family members, but I don't pay any attention to it. I just think it's how it is. Media wants something to bite on." After Napier led the Connecticut Huskies to the 2014 NCAA men's basketball championship, James tweeted his admiration for the senior point guard and his pro prospects. The Heat traded up in the 2014 NBA draft to select Napier with the No. 24 pick, sending their first-round pick, No. 26 overall, and two second-round picks to the Charlotte Hornets. James then tweeted out his pleasure with the pick. Napier is averaging 9.5 points and 4.3 assists in eight games between the Orlando and Las Vegas summer leagues for the Heat (3-5).
