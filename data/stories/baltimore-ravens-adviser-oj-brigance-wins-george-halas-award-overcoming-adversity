BALTIMORE -- O.J. Brigance, the Ravens' senior adviser for player development, has won the George Halas Award for overcoming adversity to succeed. The award, given Monday by the Professional Football Writers of America, cites Brigance's battle with Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) and how he has served as an inspiration while helping raise research funds to fight the disease through his Brigance Brigade foundation. Brigance is the first member of the Ravens to receive the honor, named for Halas, a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In May 2007, Brigance was diagnosed with ALS. He then began his fundraising work while also continuing his duties with the Ravens. Brigance played seven years with three NFL teams (Miami, Baltimore and St. Louis) and five years in the CFL. He won a Super Bowl and a Grey Cup.
