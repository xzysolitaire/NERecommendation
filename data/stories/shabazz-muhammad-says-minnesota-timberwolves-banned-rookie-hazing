Even the most lighthearted hazing has no place in the Minnesota Timberwolves' locker room. At least that's what the team has told rookie Shabazz Muhammad. Muhammad was given a Jonas Brothers backpack by his veteran teammates, but told the Los Angeles Times that team president Chris Wright and general manager Milt Newton told him he could no longer wear it. "They actually said they don't want us carrying them, but I understand with the stuff going on with the football thing," Muhammad told the Times. "They want to be separate from that. ... Now I think rookie hazing won't exist anymore." Hazing has become a hot topic in light of the developments between Miami Dolphins teammates Jonathan Martin and Richie Incognito. Martin has claimed, through lawyer David Cornwell, that he was harassed by teammates, including Incognito. "[I]t's not so much hazing, because I don't like to use that word because it's got kind of a negative connotation," Cleveland Cavaliers guard Jarrett Jack told USA Today. "It's kind of just, you having a bit of selflessness, knowing that a lot of people came before you, who paved the way for you to be here now. And getting doughnuts on game day I don't think is too much to ask. "I like to think we treat our rookies very well. At the end of the day, they're all men and they're all professionals, that's the way we want to keep it at all times, regardless of whether we ask them to get some donuts. We never lose sight of the fact that they're all teammates."
