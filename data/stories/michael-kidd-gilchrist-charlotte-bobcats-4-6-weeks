CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- It's been a tough week for former Kentucky stars and top 2012 NBA draft picks Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. The Bobcats announced Wednesday that Kidd-Gilchrist will be sidelined four to six weeks with a broken left hand, an eerily similar injury to what Davis suffered earlier this week. Kidd-Gilchrist, the No. 2 pick in the 2012 draft, suffered a non-displaced fracture of the fourth metacarpal in his left hand during Tuesday night's game at Dallas. Kidd-Gilchrist's former college teammate and friend Davis, who was selected No. 1 last year, suffered a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal in his left hand in the Pelicans game Sunday night against the New York Knicks. Davis is also expected to be out four to six weeks. Both starters could miss as many as 20 games. As freshmen they helped Kentucky win a national title in 2012 before turning pro. Kidd-Gilchrist is averaging 9.1 points and 5.3 rebounds in 26.7 minutes per game and shooting 50 percent from the field. Davis, the Pelican's power forward, is averaging 18.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game. He said earlier this week he's confident in coach Monty Williams' system and his teammates' ability to "still pull out wins, no matter who's on the floor." Davis and Kidd-Gilchrist were two of six Kentucky players drafted in 2012, four of which went in the first round after the Wildcats defeated Kansas 67-59 in the national championship.
