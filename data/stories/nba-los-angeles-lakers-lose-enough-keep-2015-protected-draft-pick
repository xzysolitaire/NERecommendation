Having started 1-7, the Los Angeles Lakers are staring at the prospect of their worst season since moving to L.A. five-plus decades ago. But there could be a reward to their patience in next May's NBA draft lottery. Every non-playoff team has incentive to lose as many games as possible to improve its draft pick, but the Lakers' stakes are even higher. Because of their ill-fated trade for Steve Nash, the Lakers owe the Phoenix Suns their first-round pick -- if it falls outside the top five selections in the 2015 draft. The Lakers keep their pick if it lands in the top five, a prospect that looks increasingly likely.
