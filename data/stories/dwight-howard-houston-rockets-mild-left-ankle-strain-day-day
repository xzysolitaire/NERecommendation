Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard has a mild left ankle strain and will not play Monday against the Utah Jazz. The team says he is day-to-day. This will be the first game Howard has missed. He is the only Rockets player to start all 66 games this season. In Sunday's 113-104 loss to the Miami Heat, Howard had 21 points and 14 rebounds but only attempted one field goal in the fourth quarter. Howard, in his first season in Houston, is averaging 18.6 points and his 12.4 rebounds are fourth in the NBA. Omer Asik will start in his place Monday night as the Rockets try to end a three-game skid. They are trying to register their longest win streak at the Toyota Center in five seasons by sending the last-place Jazz to their 10th loss in 11 games.
