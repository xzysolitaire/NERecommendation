MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies won't be at full strength against the Boston Celtics on Friday night, but the stomach virus that plagued the team in recent days is dissipating. Officially, guard Tony Allen was still listed as questionable before the game, while swingman Quincy Pondexter was doubtful, both dealing with the bug that made its way through the team while the Grizzlies were in Toronto to face the Raptors on Wednesday. Others who suffered from the virus were center Kosta Koufos, forwards Jon Leuer and Jarnell Stokes, and guards Courtney Lee and Beno Udrih. They were expected to be available against the Celtics. The stomach virus forced a handful of players to take a charter flight back from Toronto early to minimize infecting the rest of the team.
