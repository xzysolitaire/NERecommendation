NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have agreed to terms with rookie offensive tackle Taylor Lewan, the team's first-round selection and the last unsigned draft pick in the NFL, general manager Ruston Webster said Thursday. Offensive lineman Chance Warmack, Tennessee's first-round pick in 2013, missed four practices last year before his contract was sorted out. But Lewan will report with the rest of the team Friday and be on the field for the first practice of camp on Saturday. Webster discussed Lewan's signing during a radio interview with the "Midday 180" in Nashville. Webster said the issue was the structure of the contract, and the last issue to debate under the current system for rookie contracts isn't money but when a player gets his money. Lewan was selected 11th overall. He has a court date set for Oct. 28 in Michigan over charges stemming from a bar fight in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
