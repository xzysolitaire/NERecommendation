CHICAGO -- Kirk Hinrich did not play in Saturday night's 99-77 loss to the Toronto Raptors because of back stiffness. Luol Deng, after missing the last four games because of a sore Achilles, returned. He had 17 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes. Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said that Hinrich's injury didn't occur in any particular game. "He said it just stiffened up on him," Thibodeau said before the game. "Hopefully it won't be anything that lasts long." Saturday's game was the first one Hinrich missed this season, but it marked the 59th game he's missed in the last three seasons. Second-year guard Marquis Teague started in Hinrich's place. "Next guy gets in there, gets the job done," Thibodeau said. "I felt good about what D.J. did [Friday]. Marquis has had some good games for us. Getting Jimmy [Butler] back was a big plus. We got to be ready."
