OAKLAND, Calif. -- Power forward David Lee is expected to sit out Golden State's season opener at Sacramento on Wednesday night with a strained left hamstring. The Warriors said Tuesday that Lee is doubtful for the game. Coach Steve Kerr told reporters after practice that Draymond Green will likely start in Lee's place. The team also said reserve guard-forward Brandon Rush is questionable with lower back spasms. Backup guard Shaun Livingston is still recovering from offseason surgery on his right toe and will not play. Lee was injured in Friday's preseason finale against Denver and has not practiced since. He could return when the Warriors host the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night.
