DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Tentative about starting more Derrick Rose rumors, Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said the former MVP point guard has started to participate in non-contact drills during team practices, while also making it clear he will not come back this season. "Yeah, yeah, he's doing that; he's moving along fine," Thibodeau said when asked about non-contact drills. "He has picked it up a little bit. But there's still no contact. He's out for the year, but he's doing well." Told that the question wasn't about making a comeback either in the regular season or the playoffs, Thibodeau stopped that statement in its tracks. "I'm just beating you to the next [question]," the coach said. Rose tore his right meniscus Nov. 22, and had season-ending surgery three days later. He had played in just 10 games after missing all of last season with a torn left ACL. Despite recent rumors that he might return for the playoffs, the Bulls have remained steadfast that Rose won't play this season. He could return to the court this summer, though, for USA Basketball and possibly participate in the World Cup in Spain. That figures to be Rose's first chance at contact since the Bulls won't be taking part in any scrimmages at practice this late in the season. "You know, we're not practicing real long this time of the year, but all the non-contact stuff he's doing," Thibodeau said.
