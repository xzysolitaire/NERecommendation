Fresh off signing his first NFL free-agent contract, former Utah offensive lineman Zane Beadles is ready to give back. Beadles announced Monday that he'll donate $750,000 to Utah's football program, the largest gift ever given to the school by a former player. Of that sum, $500,000 will go to the Zane Beadles' Sports Medicine Center and $250,000 to the Zane Beadles' Offensive Line Scholarship. Beadles signed a five-year, $30 million contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars in March that includes $13 million guaranteed. He spent his first five NFL seasons with the Denver Broncos. "This is something I've known I wanted to do ever since I left school," Beadles said in a statement. "The University of Utah was such a great place for me. I don't think I'd be where I am today without the University of Utah. I am excited to pledge this money to the U and give back to the place that helped shape me into the man I am today." Denver selected Beadles in the second round of the 2010 draft after he started four seasons for the Utes, including the 2009 season when he was named a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America. "We are very thankful to Zane for his generous donation," Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. "Zane was an outstanding student-athlete and community member during his time here and is another in a long line of former players to give back to our university. He is a great source of pride to all of us at Utah and we are appreciative of his loyalty and generosity." Other major donations from former Utes football players include Alex Smith ($500,000), Jordan Gross ($500,000), Steve Smith ($400,000) and Paul Soliai ($250,000), according to the school.
