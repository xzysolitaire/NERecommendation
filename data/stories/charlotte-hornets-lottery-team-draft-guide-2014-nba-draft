Steve Dykes/USA TODAY SportsAl Jefferson and Kemba Walker are good building blocks, but Charlotte needs more scorers. NBA Insiders Amin Elhassan and Bradford Doolittle break down the draft profile, needs and potential picks of the 14 teams eligible for the NBA draft lottery this year. With some help from Chad Ford's Big Board, we take a look at the Charlotte Hornets. Personnel needs: SG, PF/C Major need: The Hornets (it feels weird calling them this again!) took huge steps toward becoming an elite defensive outfit that improved as the 2013-14 season wore on. They added a go-to scorer in Al Jefferson, one of five players to average 20 points and 10 boards this season. But they still struggled to put points on the board (24th in offensive efficiency at 101 points per 100 possessions) and were one of the worst in the league in 3-point makes, attempts and efficiency. Adding scoring of any kind will help, but 3-point shooting in particular will go a long way to improving overall team efficiency by giving Jefferson and Kemba Walker more space to operate. Quiet need: It's too early to write off Charlotte's young backup bigs, Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo, but they were up and down this season and the Hornets should not feel compelled to wait for them to come around developmentally if talented bigs are available on the board.
