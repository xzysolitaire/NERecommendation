Sandy Alomar Jr., Jay Bell and Andy Green are among seven confirmed candidates for the Arizona Diamondbacks' manager position, the team announced Wednesday on Twitter. Arizona is looking to replace Kirk Gibson, who was fired on Friday. Gibson took over as interim manager in 2010 when A.J. Hinch was fired, then got the job without the interim title. In 2011, his first full season, he led the Diamondbacks to the NL West title and was named major league manager of the year. But his next two teams went 81-81, and this year, with a squad riddled with injuries, the Diamondbacks finished the season with the worst record in the majors at 64-98. Chief baseball officer Tony La Russa recently hired Dave Stewart to replace Kevin Towers as the team's general manager.
