We love watching people with elite-level talent play against regular folks -- it really showcases how good even the worst pro athlete is compared with people like you or me. Jason Williams isn't at the top of his game anymore -- the former guard hasn't played in the NBA since 2011 -- but he's still more than able to show off the flashy passes that earned him the nickname White Chocolate: Watching Williams has never been a waste of time, and even though he's pushing 40, it's still fun to watch him predict the future on the court. It looks as though he's still having fun, too -- high-fiving the camera, trash-talking and pointing out that ''I ain't travel since I was 6.'' We'll take his word for it.
