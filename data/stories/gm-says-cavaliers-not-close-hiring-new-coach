CHICAGO -- Cleveland general manager David Griffin says the Cavaliers are not close to hiring a new coach. Griffin says the Cavs "don't have a real specific timetable" and doesn't "anticipate anything happening anytime soon." There had been reports that the Cavaliers might meet with candidates during the NBA draft combine this week. But Griffin says "nothing along those lines" has happened. The Cavaliers fired Mike Brown and removed the interim tag from Griffin on Monday, a month after they finished a disappointing 33-49 season.
