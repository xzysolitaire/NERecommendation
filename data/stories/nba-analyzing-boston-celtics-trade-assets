After Wednesday's three-team trade with the Golden State Warriors and Miami Heat, Boston Celtics president Danny Ainge has now made a pair of deals within the past two weeks. With the trade deadline five weeks away, Ainge's real score may still be out there. We know that Ainge is fond of blockbuster trades. Not only did he build a championship team in a single summer by dealing for Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in 2007, he has unsuccessfully pursued stars such as Allen Iverson and Chris Paul in the past. Now the Celtics might have the opportunity to make a big trade built around Rajon Rondo, who is expected to return Friday from his ACL rupture, or perhaps even their forthcoming lottery pick. After all, the last time Boston picked in the lottery, in 2007, their No. 5 pick went to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Allen. This year's Boston team is in a different position, at the start of the rebuilding process rather than the conclusion of it, but if the Celtics could get a star young talent to accelerate the process, they'd have to consider a bold move making use of their unique assets. Between their collection of young talent, overpaid veterans and draft picks, Boston has an interesting set of pieces to include in trades. Let's take a look, going from least valuable in a trade to most valuable. To read more of what Kevin Pelton thinks the Boston Celtics will do with all of their trade assets, become an Insider today.
