OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry will not play for the Golden State Warriors against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night because of what the team is calling a "mild concussion." Curry was injured in the fourth quarter of Golden State's 98-87 victory at Utah on Monday night. The star point guard left the game after hitting his head on the court in a scramble for a loose ball. The Warriors said Tuesday that Curry's only symptom was a headache, which had since dissipated. His status is day to day. Curry is averaging 19.9 points, 8.7 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game this season.
