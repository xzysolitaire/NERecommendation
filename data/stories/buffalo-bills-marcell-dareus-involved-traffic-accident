HAMBURG, N.Y. -- Police in upstate New York say Buffalo Bills defensive lineman Marcell Dareus was involved in a traffic accident last week. Hamburg Police Lt. Bob Krone said the accident happened Friday afternoon and is still under investigation. He didn't provide any other details. The accident occurred after the Bills' final practice of a three-day minicamp. Dareus is already facing charges in Alabama, where he was arrested last month for possession of synthetic marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He called it a youthful mistake. His agent, Todd France, didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Dareus was selected third overall in the 2011 draft and is in his fourth season with the Bills. The 24-year-old played for Alabama. The Buffalo News first reported the accident on its website Monday evening. According to the paper, Dareus was arrested last week by Hamburg town police on three misdemeanor and four vehicle and traffic charges, apparently in connection with a car race. The race ended with Dareus accused of leaving the scene of a property damage accident and other offenses, sources told The News.Â
