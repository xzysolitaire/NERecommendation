Michael Carter-Williams and the Philadelphia 76ers have set a target date of Nov. 13 for his return, a source close to the situation told ESPN.com. Carter-Williams, who won Rookie of the Year honors last season, has been out since May following surgery on his right shoulder. He averaged 16.7 points, 6.3 assists and 6.2 rebounds for the 76ers team that finished with the second-worst record in the NBA. A source told ESPN that Carter-Williams is optimistic about returning Nov. 13 in Dallas. However, there remains a belief that the team will hold him back, since general manager Sam Hinkie has shown little desire to win games this season and instead remains hopeful of landing another top draft pick in order to rebuild the franchise through high draft picks. Philadelphia drafted former Kansas big man Joel Embiid, who could miss the entire season due to a foot injury, with the third overall pick in the draft -- and also acquired Dario Saric via a draft-day trade with the 12th overall pick. Saric is playing overseas this season, and it's still unclear whether he will join the organization for the 2015-16 campaign. Nerlens Noel, who missed all of last season while recovering from a torn ACL, has missed the last three preseason games due to an upper respiratory infection. Philadelphia started Elliot Williams and Tony Wroten in the backcourt with Hollis Thompson, Brandon Davies and Henry Sims on the front line in Monday's preseason loss to Brooklyn. The 76ers open the regular season next Wednesday in Indiana.
