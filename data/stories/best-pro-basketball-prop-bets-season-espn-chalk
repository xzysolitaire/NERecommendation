With the 2014-15 NBA season tipping off, we've got two perspectives on attractive prop bets. Vegas handicapper Erin Rynning shares his choices, with NBA Insider Kevin Pelton weighing in based on projections from his SCHOENE projection system. MVP Stephen Curry | PG | Golden State Warriors | 16-1 odds Erin Rynning: No question, LeBron James is the odds-on favorite to win the NBA MVP award this season and deservedly so. However, Curry fits the mold of a long-shot play. The Warriors have a new coach in Steve Kerr, and though Kerr's a virtual unknown from a coaching standpoint, he has brought with him extremely qualified assistants. On the offensive end of the court, that assistant is Alvin Gentry. Gentry carries with him many facets of the Phoenix Suns' offense, which helped Steve Nash win the MVP award in 2004-05 and 2005-06, along with a fast pace.
