The Donald Sterling saga is seemingly near a close, with confirmed reports of a winning bid from Steve Ballmer worth $2.0 billion to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers. It marks the end of a 33-year tenure that has seen more downs than ups; years of inept stewardship, mercurial behavior and a brand that stood for the laughingstock of professional sports. What does new ownership mean for the Clippers? The purchase price At $2 billion, the Clippers became the largest sale in professional sports history -- the Clippers! Ballmer ended up paying more than triple what he tried to pay to purchase the Sacramento Kings last year.
