The Toronto Raptors will meet with free-agent forward Andray BlatcheÂ on Wednesday in Las Vegas, according to league sources. The talented 6-foot-11 forward was a key member of the Brooklyn Nets last season, averaging 11.2 points and 5.3 rebounds off the bench. Blatche, a 27-year-old veteran of nine seasons, has career averages of 10.1 points and 5.4 rebounds. He played the past two seasons in Brooklyn, but the Nets have not shown much interest in re-signing him. His athleticism and versatility, however, would seem to make him a nice fit with the Raptors, one of the Eastern Conference's young, up-and-coming teams.
