And in that respect, Spain's 65-52 loss to France in the FIBA Basketball World Cup quarterfinals should not come as a complete surprise. The Spaniards had so much going for them that they actually became the overwhelming title favorite over Team USA, arguably the best team in the tournament. Spain boasted a deep and talented squad with nine players who have NBA experience, and Spain's core had played together for years. It dominated each of its first six games, winning four by more than 20 points. However, sometimes being an overwhelming favorite to win becomes as much a burden as it is an opportunity. Here is where Team USA now finds itself. As Marc Stein suggested Wednesday, who can stop the U.S.? Well, whenever I found myself coaching in a game as the underdog, I tried to convince my team that the longer we stayed in the game, the tighter our heavily favored opponent would get. They were supposed to win while we had little to lose. Are there any lessons for Team USA to learn from Spain's ouster? Let's first take a look at how Spain lost and then the subsequent lessons for the Americans.
