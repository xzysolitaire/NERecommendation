Back by popular demand, here's my second annual look at one-tool players, NBA specialists who can fill up a single category in fantasy basketball. All-round talents like LeBron James, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook will be off the board quickly in fantasy drafts, so picking some of the names below might be more efficient ways to satisfy specific category needs.

Rebounds Omer Asik | New Orleans Pelicans 2013-14 rebounding: 7.9 per game (14.1 per 36 minutes) After a season spent being Dwight Howard's reluctant understudy, Asik is again free to reclaim his position as one of the best defensive centers in the game, playing the role of enforcer for Anthony Davis in New Orleans. Asik's brilliance on the defensive end relies heavily on positioning and contesting, and while it does not yield superlative numbers in the shot-blocking category, he is a dominant rebounder on both ends of the court.
