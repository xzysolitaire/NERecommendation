ARLINGTON, Texas -- Texas Rangers co-chairman Ray Davis said he would like to extend the contract of general manager Jon Daniels by the time spring training starts. Daniels has one year remaining on his contract and was given the lead role in hiring the franchise's 18th full-time manager over the past two months. The job went to Jeff Banister, who signed a three-year deal with a club option for a fourth season. The financial terms were not disclosed. "We've been consumed for the last month on this, so [Daniels' extension] will fall in place," Davis said. Daniels was promoted to president, baseball operations and GM in March 2013 as part of a restructuring of the front office which also saw Nolan Ryan taking on a lesser role. Daniels, who was Baseball America's major league executive of the year in 2010, has been the team's GM since 2005. "I love the organization and I love the community," Daniels said. "It's not really something for me to think about."
