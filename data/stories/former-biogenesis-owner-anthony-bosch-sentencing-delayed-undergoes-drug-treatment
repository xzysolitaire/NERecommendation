MIAMI -- The former owner of the South Florida clinic that supplied performance-enhancing substances to Major League Baseball players will get more drug rehabilitation. A federal judge on Wednesday agreed to delay sentencing for Anthony Bosch from Dec. 18 to Feb. 17. Bosch lawyer Guy Lewis says Bosch needs a second phase of treatment for his admitted cocaine addiction. Bosch pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to distribute testosterone to MLB players and others from the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables. Among the customers was New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, who was suspended for the entire 2014 season. Bosch faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence but will likely get less because of his cooperation in the Biogenesis investigation. Rodriguez cousin Yuri Sucart and others are facing trial.
