CLEVELAND -- A larger-than-life LeBron James will again tower over downtown. The city's planning commission approved artwork on Friday for a 10-story-high banner of the NBA superstar, his arms outstretched and "Cleveland" across the back of his jersey. It will hang across the street from Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cavaliers. The Nike-sponsored banner is similar to the black-and-white "Witness" banner that adorned an outside wall of Sherwin-Williams Co.'s headquarters for years. It was removed after James left for the Miami Heat in 2010. The new banner is expected to be installed before the Cavs' home opener on Oct. 30 against New York. James signed as a free agent with the Cavs this summer, returning to his home state to attempt to win Cleveland's first major pro sports championship since 1964.
