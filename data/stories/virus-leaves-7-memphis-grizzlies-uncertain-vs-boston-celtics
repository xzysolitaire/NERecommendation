MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Seven members of the Memphis Grizzlies now are dealing with a stomach virus, and their status is uncertain for Friday's game with the Boston Celtics. The Grizzlies announced Thursday that guards Tony Allen, Courtney Lee and Beno Udrih, forwards Jon Leuer and Jarnell Stokes, center Kosta Koufos and guard/forward Quincy Pondexter all are ill and are questionable for the Boston game. Pondexter and Stokes are new additions to the injury list. The other five Grizzlies didn't play in a 96-92 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday due to the virus that kept them away from the arena. The Grizzlies also waived guard Kalin Lucas and center Hassan Whiteside on Thursday, a day after signing them for protection in Toronto.
