SAN ANTONIO -- The Red Rocket is coming back to the Spurs. The team announced on Monday that they have re-signed Matt Bonner. Terms were not disclosed, but the veteran will return for a ninth season in San Antonio. That's the longest tenure outside of the trio of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Bonner only played sparingly last season, averaging 3.2 points in 11.3 minutes in 61 games. But he shot 42.9 percent from 3-point range and is a beloved member of the team both inside the organization and in the community. Bonner ranks third in franchise history in 3-pointers made and seventh in 3-point field goal percentage.
