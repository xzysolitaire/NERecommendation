ATLANTA -- The Braves have traded minor league outfielder Kyle Wren, the son of former Atlanta general manager Frank Wren, to the Milwaukee Brewers for right-hander Zach Quintana. Kyle Wren, currently playing in the Arizona Fall League, was an eighth-round draft pick from Georgia Tech in 2013. He hit a combined .290 with 46 steals at Class A Lynchburg and Double-A Mississippi this year. Frank Wren was fired following the 2014 season. Quintana, a third-round pick in 2012, was 4-5 with a 5.70 ERA in 25 games for Class A Wisconsin this year. Quintana, 20, has pitched in relief and as a starter.
