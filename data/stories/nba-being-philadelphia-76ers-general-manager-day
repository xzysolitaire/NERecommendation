That turned out well, as Philly made the Finals just four years later and won the title a decade after hitting bottom. However, the current iteration of the 76ers can't really follow the blueprint of their predecessors who rose quickly, thanks to an influx of talent from the defunct ABA, in the form of Julius Erving and George McGinnis. Unless there are some high-flying, elite players in some professional league we don't know about, what can these Sixers do to dig out of their current hole? Where do the Sixers reside on the arc of contention? The Sixers have a point differential of minus-11.4 this season, the 10th-worst mark in NBA history. It's getting worse, too. Philadelphia has dropped 25 straight games, and 35 of 38 since an improbable four-game winning streak sandwiched around New Year's Day. Suffice to say, the Sixers' playoff odds are zero. Philly is the league's youngest team with a minutes-weighted age of just 23.9 years old. And the only two possible core players on the roster -- Michael Carter-Williams and Nerlens Noel -- have a combined age barely older than Steve Nash.
