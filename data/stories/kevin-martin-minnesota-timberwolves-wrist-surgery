Minnesota Timberwolves guard Kevin Martin had surgery on his fractured right wrist Tuesday and is expected to miss six to eight weeks, the team announced. Martin injured his right wrist with 6:48 to play in the first quarter on Wednesday when he was fouled while shooting a 3-pointer. From that point on, Martin went on to score 34 points and make 6 of 9 3-pointers in Minnesota's 115-99 win over the New York Knicks. The Wolves are playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio, who is out indefinitely with a sprained left ankle, and starting center Nikola Pekovic, who will miss at least the next two games with a sprained right wrist. On a team starving for offense, Martin was the best thing the Wolves had going. He scored 34 points in a defeat in Dallas that ended a six-game road trip, then got the Wolves off to a great start against the Knicks with 13 points in the first quarter. Martin is averaging 20.4 points and shooting 48.1 percent on 3-pointers this season.
