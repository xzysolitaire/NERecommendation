PORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland reserve point guard Mo Williams is unlikely to play in Game 3 against San Antonio on Saturday night because of a groin injury. Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts told reporters Friday he doesn't anticipate Williams will play. Earl Watson and Will Barton will come off the bench in his place. Williams, who provided a spark for the Blazers all season in backing up starting point guard Damian Lillard, played only 9 minutes in Portland's 114-97 loss in San Antonio on Thursday night. He is averaging 7.4 points and 23.4 minutes in the postseason.
