LOS ANGELES -- Center Ryan Hollins agreed to a one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, sources told ESPNLosAngeles.com. Hollins, who had been talking to the Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs this offseason, agreed to join the Kings when they fully guaranteed his one-year deal for around $1.3 million. The 7-foot, 240-pound center averaged 2.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in 7.9 minutes per game with the Los Angeles Clippers last season. Outside of his rookie season in 2006-07 season, those were all career lows for the veteran big man. Hollins, who has averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 rebounds in 12.0 minutes over his eight-year career with Charlotte, Dallas, Minnesota, Cleveland, Boston and the Clippers, will be reunited with his UCLA and Clippers teammate Darren Collison, who also signed with the Kings earlier this offseason.
