LOS ANGELES -- Kurt Rambis was among the pool of initial candidates to interview for the Los Angeles Lakers' coaching position, according to a league source. Rambis, currently an assistant coach for the Lakers, interviewed with general manager Mitch Kupchak last week. Former Lakers coach Mike Dunleavy also interviewed for the opening last week, as did former Lakers player Byron Scott. The Lakers are not in any rush to hire a coach. While Kupchak told reporters last week that the team ideally would fill the vacancy prior to the June 26 NBA draft, in which L.A. holds the No. 7 pick, the search very well could drag into July, when free agency begins. "This is going to be a long process," one team source said. The Lakers plan to interview current Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach Alvin Gentry on Wednesday, a source confirmed to ESPNLosAngeles.com. The Lakers' interest in Gentry was earlier reported by the L.A. Times. The team also will bring former Memphis Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins in for an interview this week, ESPNLosAngeles.com confirmed. The Lakers' interest in Hollins was earlier reported by Yahoo! Sports. Rambis joined Mike D'Antoni's coaching staff as an assistant last season after working as an analyst for ESPN and Time Warner Cable SportsNet, the Lakers' cable television network. Prior to that, he had three previous stints as an assistant coach for the Lakers, spanning 12 seasons in total. He also was the Lakers' head coach in 1998-99, going 24-13 after Del Harris was fired. Rambis, 56, went 32-132 in two seasons as head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Rambis also played for the Lakers for nine seasons (1981-88, 1993-95), winning four championships.
