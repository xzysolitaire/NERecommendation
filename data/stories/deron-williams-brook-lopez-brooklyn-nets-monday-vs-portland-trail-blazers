NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets point guard Deron Williams, center Brook Lopez and reserve forward Andrei Kirilenko will not play in Monday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers due to injury, the team announced. Meanwhile, power forward Kevin Garnett and small forward Paul Pierce will play. Garnett was listed as probable, while Pierce was considered a game-time decision. Williams (sprained left ankle), Lopez (sprained left ankle), Kirilenko (back spasms), Garnett (sprained right ankle) and Pierce (sore left groin) all missed Saturday's loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Nets coach Jason Kidd said there is "no timetable" for the return of Lopez or Williams. Kirilenko did not make the trip West with the team and has not played since Nov. 8. Reserve point guard Shaun Livingston will start in place of Williams, and reserve big man Reggie Evans will start in place of Lopez. Shooting guard Joe Johnson is currently the Nets' only healthy regular starter.
