For the second consecutive year, the NFL supplemental draft did not have a player selected. Last year, 32 NFL teams passed on six eligible candidates for the supplemental draft. This year, teams elected not to use a draft choice on four candidates. The four players were New Mexico wide receiver/running back Chase Clayton, North Carolina linebacker Darius Lipford, Virginia Lynchburg defensive tackle LeKendrick Ross and SMU running back Traylon Shead. They now become free agents who can sign with any team. The last time a player was taken in the supplemental draft was 2012. The Cleveland Browns used a second-round choice to select wide receiver Josh Gordon.
