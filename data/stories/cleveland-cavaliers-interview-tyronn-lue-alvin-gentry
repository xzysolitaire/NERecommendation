CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers are working their way down the Los Angeles Clippers' bench to maybe find their next coach. The team will interview Clippers assistants Tyronn Lue and Alvin Gentry over the next two days for their coaching job, a person with knowledge of the meetings told The Associated Press. Lue, who has spent the past four seasons working under Doc Rivers in Boston and Los Angeles, is meeting with the Cavs on Thursday and Gentry is scheduled to sit down with the Cavs on Friday. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team is not commenting during its search. The Cavaliers are looking for their third coach in three years after firing Mike Brown -- for the second time -- this month following a 33-49 season. The team interviewed Chicago assistant Adrian Griffin on Tuesday and is expected to interview former Memphis coach Lionel Hollins. The 37-year-old Lue played 11 seasons in the NBA for seven teams. He retired following the 2008 season with Orlando. A pesky defender as a player, Lue worked in the Celtics' front office from 2009-11 before joining Rivers' staff. The Cavs are being meticulous in their search. After firing Byron Scott following the 2012-13 season, owner Dan Gilbert rushed to re-hire Brown, who guided Cleveland to the NBA finals in 2007 but was dismissed following the 2010 season. The Cavs' job became more attractive recently after the club won the NBA draft lottery for the second straight year and third time in four seasons. New general manager David Griffin promised an expansive search not limited to the pro ranks. The team reportedly reached out to Florida coach Billy Donovan, who has previous flirtations with the NBA. This week, Donovan would not guarantee he would be back for another season with the Gators. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley, however, said Wednesday he has not been contacted by any NBA teams to speak with Donovan.
