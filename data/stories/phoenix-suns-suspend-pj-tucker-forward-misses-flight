BOSTON -- Phoenix Suns forward P.J. Tucker has been suspended for violating team rules. Tucker was listed as inactive for Monday night's 118-114 victory over the Boston Celtics. Suns spokeswoman Julie Fie said Tucker "basically missed the plane" to Boston on Sunday. Earlier this season, the NBA suspended Tucker for three games following his guilty plea to "super extreme" driving while intoxicated. "Super extreme" DUI under Arizona law is for persons whose blood alcohol level exceeds .20 percent. Police say that just after his May 10 arrest in Scottsdale, Tucker had a blood alcohol level of .222. The legal limit in Arizona is .08. He signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract in July. Tucker is averaging 6.6 points and 5.6 rebounds per game this season.
