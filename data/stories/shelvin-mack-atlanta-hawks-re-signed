ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Hawks have re-signed guard Shelvin Mack, who general manager Danny Ferry says proved to be a good fit for coach Mike Budenholzer's system. Mack averaged 7.5 points and ranked second on the team with 3.7 assists per game. He played in 73 games, including 11 starts, and ranked seventh in the NBA with his average of 3.04 assists per turnover. Ferry said Friday the 24-year-old Mack showed the "toughness and level of unselfishness that we truly value." Terms of the deal were not released. As a starter, Mack averaged 10.5 points and 4.7 assists. He previously played with Washington and Philadelphia.
