We asked our ESPN Forecast panel who would prevail in Round 1 of the Eastern Conference playoffs, and the voters appear to value the teams with more playoff experience. The panel sees higher seeds Indiana, Miami and Chicago moving on to the next round. But it also sees an upset brewing in the 3-6 matchup, predicting the veteran Nets to upset their division rivals from Toronto in six games. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games, and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
