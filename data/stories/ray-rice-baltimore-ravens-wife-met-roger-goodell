Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and his wife met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell at league headquarters in New York on Monday, league source confirmed to ESPN. This is an important step as the NFL determines its discipline for Rice, who was arrested and indicted for striking his then-fianc√©e. Rice pleaded not guilty to a third-degree charge of aggravated assault and was later accepted into a pretrial intervention program last month. The league could fine and suspend Rice under the personal conduct policy. This is his first major off-the-field incident. The New York Post had earlier reported the news. Rice was arrested and charged with simple assault-domestic violence on Feb. 15 after a physical altercation with Janay Palmer at the Revel Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Palmer also was charged in the incident. He was indicted by a grand jury in late March for allegedly striking Palmer. The two were married one day later. Rice has participated in all of the Ravens' offseason practices. He is expected to attend the Ravens' mandatory minicamp, which begins Tuesday. He is one of four Ravens players arrested this offseason.
