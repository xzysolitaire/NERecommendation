Jordan Adams has decided to enter the 2014 NBA draft after all,Â UCLA coach Steve Alford confirmed to ESPN. One week after meeting with his coaches at UCLA and telling them he would remain in school, Adams informed them late Saturday night that he had changed his mind. The 6-foot-5 Adams, who averaged 17.4 points per game last season, becomes the third member of the Bruins to declare for this year's draft, joining point guard Kyle Anderson and reserve guard Zach LaVine. Alford said he was unsure why Adams changed his mind. "I don't know why," Alford said in a text message to ESPN. "We lose four of five starters." The Bruins return Norman Powell, Bryce Alford and Tony Parker, and will add Isaac Hamilton and three Top 100 big men: Kevon Looney, Thomas Welsh and Jonah Bolden. "Jordan informed us yesterday that he has decided to enter this year's NBA Draft, "Alford said in a statement. "He had two terrific seasons while at UCLA. I enjoyed coaching him this past season and wish him and his family all the best."
