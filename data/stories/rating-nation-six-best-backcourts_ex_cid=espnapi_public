To be successful in college basketball today, you need to have strong guard play. Performance on the perimeter is so vital for winning teams. It is not an easy task to pick the teams with the best backcourts in America. You could have a great argument in bars across the country. There are so many good guards out there. I am going to give you my opinion. Here are my super six backcourts going into the 2014-15 campaign: 1. Duke: I love the versatility of Duke's guards. There is experience blended in with new talent. Having Quinn Cook, Rasheed Sulaimon, Tyus Jones and Matt Jones gives the Blue Devils a slight edge. 2. Kentucky: The Harrison twins showed a lot in the NCAA tournament last season. Add Devin Booker and Tyler Ulis and the Cats are loaded. 3. Gonzaga: Gary Bell Jr. and Kevin Pangos were already solid. Now USC transfer Byron Wesley joins the group, making Mark Few very happy. 4. North Carolina: Marcus Paige is an All-Solid Gold performer. Nate Britt showed flashes last season. Newcomers will help the backcourt too. 5. Wichita State: Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker are a super duo. Tekele Cotton is another veteran to watch. 6. Arizona: T.J. McConnell is a steady veteran. Teaming up with Gabe York gives the Wildcats a terrific tandem. Keep an eye on newcomer Kadeem Allen.
