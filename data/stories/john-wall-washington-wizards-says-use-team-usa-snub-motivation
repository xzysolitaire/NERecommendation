John Wall was left off USA Basketball's national team pool last week, but he says he will use his omission as motivation. "It's nothing I could do. It's nothing I can say, and I don't want nobody to baby-sit me or try to make it work for me," Wall told The Washington Post. "They made their list, they made their decision, and that's what they're happy with, and I just have to look past that." Wall played with the U.S. team in minicamps over the summer in 2012 and 2013, but he was left off the list of players from which coach Mike Krzyzewski will select the rosters for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Teammate Bradley Beal was named to the list, but Wall has the disadvantage of playing a well-stocked position. Seven point guards were named to the player pool: Derrick Rose, Chris Paul, Deron Williams, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and Damian Lillard. Wall said it wasn't the first time he's missed a cut. "It's more motivation because I didn't make the McDonald's [high school All-American] game. I wasn't national player of the year. I wasn't rookie of the year," Wall told the Post. "So those are just tabs I keep to motivate myself to prove people wrong."
