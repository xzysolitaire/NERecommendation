Tom Penn: Guys, it's early in the season, but there are some former big-name first-rounders who continue to confound teams. These guys have enormous potential and skills, but those have been overshadowed by bad decisions and immaturity. Which player is squandering or has squandered his talent the most?Â  Kevin Pelton: I would say Michael Beasley because I thought that guy as a college player was every bit as good in his one season at Kansas State as Kevin Durant had been a couple of years earlier at Texas. As a freshman, Beasley was better than Blake Griffin while playing in the same league at Oklahoma, and everything statistically pointed to him being not just a star in the NBA, but a superstar. The reasons he hasn't done it? I think there are some physical issues as far as him being a bit of a "tweener" and never being able to quite settle in at either small forward or power forward. But it's been mostly about not understanding what's a good shot, understanding how to get a good shot and his complete lack of focus. This made it difficult for the Miami Heat and other teams to trust him. Penn: Yeah, a No. 2 overall pick [in 2008]. He got a non-guaranteed contract this year, didn't he? Pelton: Yup. The Grizzlies signed him, then he left at the beginning of camp and signed with Yao Ming's Shanghai Sharks. Penn: Chad, who would you say? Chad Ford: He had a good FIBA World Championship, but to me DeMarcus Cousins could be a superstar in the NBA.
