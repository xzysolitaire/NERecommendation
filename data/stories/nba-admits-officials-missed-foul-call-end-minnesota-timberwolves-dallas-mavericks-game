The NBA acknowledged Tuesday that officials missed a foul call that would have given the Minnesota Timberwolves a chance to tie the score with one second remaining in a 100-98 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. "Through postgame video review, we have determined that Minnesota's Kevin Love was fouled on the right arm by Dallas' Shawn Marion while attempting a two-point field goal," NBA president of basketball operations Rod Thorn said in a statement. "Love should have been awarded two free throws with one second left on the clock." After receiving an inbounds pass with three seconds remaining, Love dribbled once to his left and tried to go up for a long jumper. He was stripped by Marion and immediately raised his hands and looked to the referee for a call. "He got fouled," Minnesota coach Rick Adelman said after the game. "I wonder what that would have been if [Dirk] Nowitzki, LeBron James, all the top players in the league -- a guy reaches on a last-second shot like that, instead of challenging it. "Maybe they don't understand that Kevin is one of the top five players in this league. You make that call. But they didn't." Added Love, who had 36 points, 11 rebounds and four assists: "I'm the type of person that if you see a foul, an obvious foul, you call it. And I thought that was pretty, pretty obvious. ... You look at the replay and it was obvious he got arm." Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who has been fined many times over the years for criticizing officiating, recently praised the league office for its transparency in publicly acknowledging poor calls.
