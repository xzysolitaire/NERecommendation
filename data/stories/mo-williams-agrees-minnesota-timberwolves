Veteran guard Mo Williams is signing with the Minnesota Timberwolves, his representatives announced. Chicago-based Priority Sports tweeted Monday that Williams has committed to join the Wolves after spending the past season with the Portland Trail Blazers. Williams later addressed the move on Twitter, writing: Sources told ESPN.com that Williams is signing a one-year deal with Minnesota worth $3.75 million. Williams, who maintains his offseason home in the Dallas area, had multiple face-to-face meetings early in free agency with the Mavericks, but Dallas opted to sign Jameer NelsonÂ at a starting salary of $2.73 million. Williams held out for more and found it with the Wolves, who have been shopping guard J.J. Barea and Alexey Shved in advance of this signing to ease a logjam in their backcourt. The Wolves, sources said, have been looking to shed the contracts of swingman Kevin Martin or Barea in any Kevin Love trade. Williams, 31, has played for the Utah Jazz (twice), Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Clippers and Trail Blazers in his 11 NBA seasons.
