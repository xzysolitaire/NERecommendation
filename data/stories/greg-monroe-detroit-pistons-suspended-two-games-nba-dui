NEW YORK -- Detroit Pistons center Greg Monroe has been suspended for two games without pay for pleading guilty to driving while visibly impaired in Michigan. The NBA announced the penalty Tuesday, a day after the Pistons signed the restricted free agent to a $5.48 million, one-year qualifying offer. Monroe's suspension will begin with the first game of the regular season. He apologized to his family, the team and fans in a statement released by the Pistons. In it, Monroe says he takes "full responsibility" and made a "regrettable mistake." The team says he has "taken responsibility in a conscientious manner." The 24-year-old player averaged 15.2 points and 9.3 rebounds last season.
