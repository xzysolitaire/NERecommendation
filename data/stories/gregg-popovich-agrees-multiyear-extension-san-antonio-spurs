Gregg Popovich has agreed to a multiyear contract extension to continue coaching the reigning NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs announced the extension Wednesday but did not disclose terms. Popovich, 65, has coached San Antonio to five NBA titles since becoming the team's coach in 1996-97. The Spurs won their first championship since 2007 last month when they defeated the Miami Heat in five games in the NBA Finals. With Tim Duncan, Boris Diaw and the rest of San Antonio's key players all set to return next season, it was no surprise that Popovich has signed on for a few more years. He is 1,116-533 in his career, including the playoffs, and won his third NBA Coach of the Year award this season after leading the Spurs to an NBA-best 62 wins in the regular season.
