As if the 29 teams he's competing against in the NBA weren't enough, LeBron James now has another challenger -- the Cleveland Browns.  After James announced Friday he was returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Browns Pro Bowl cornerback Joe Haden threw down the gauntlet: Which team will bring a championship to Cleveland first? "LeBron makes things happen pretty quickly, so we're going to have to get to it," Haden said Friday on NFL Network's "NFL Total Access." "I say it's going to be a tight fight. I know me and [Johnny] Manziel will be pushing to make that happen before. That's why LeBron is coming here, to bring a championship to the city, and I'm trying to do the same thing." The city of Cleveland hasn't been home to a major professional sports championship since the Browns won the championship in 1964. With the return of James to the Cavaliers and the draft-day addition of Manziel to the Browns, though, buzz is bigger in "Believeland" than ever.  "It's a great day in Cleveland," Haden said. "It's been almost overwhelming. I was actually having my football camp when people that were at my camp -- peoples' parents -- were like, 'Oh my goodness, LeBron's here. LeBron's here. LeBron's coming back home.' I'm super excited. I've been a really, really big LeBron supporter." Haden joked during the show that he'd recruit James, a former high school receiver at St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, Ohio, to be a two-sport star.  "If he wants to come [play for the Browns], I'd welcome him with open arms," Haden said. "He might be the only person I could give 23."
