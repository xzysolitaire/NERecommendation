SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Vernon Davis was all smiles Thursday. "I'm elated,' the Pro Bowl tight end said hours before the San Francisco 49ers started training camp along with Davis. Elation wasn't exactly a word Davis used this offseason to describe his situation with the team. He stayed away from the voluntary portion of the offseason and then missed the mandatory minicamp last month because he wanted a new contract. Davis, 30, is the fourth highest paid tight end in the NFL. Yet, Davis ended the holdout before it got serious and reported to camp on time Wednesday. He said Thursday his focus is not on his contract and is on training camp. "Everybody always wants a (better) deal. Every player in the league. It's just the nature of the game." In the end, Davis, a key part of the 49ers' Super Bowl hopes, said being back with his teammates for the hunt brought him back. "It was a very easy decision," Davis said. "All you have to do is think about the team. That's what I did. I thought about my teammates, especially some of the guys like Frank Gore, guys that are on the last end of their contract and guys who I love and would die for. (There's) nothing like being here ... Any time I'm away from these guys, I'm hurting. It hurt me to be away from this group because we have such a special group. We definitely have a playoff team and we definitely want to get back to where we left off."
