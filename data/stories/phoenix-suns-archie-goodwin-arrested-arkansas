LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Phoenix Suns guard Archie Goodwin was arrested on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in his hometown of Little Rock. Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler says Goodwin was arrested May 4 outside a Little Rock skating rink after a trooper heard him cursing and "exhibiting aggressive gestures" toward another person. Sadler says the trooper told Goodwin to stop cursing, then arrested him when he continued acting aggressively and that Goodwin tried to break free while being arrested. He was taken to jail and is to appear in court June 3. A Suns spokeswoman did not immediately return phone calls for comment. Goodwin was the 29th overall pick from Kentucky in last year's NBA draft and just completed his rookie season.
