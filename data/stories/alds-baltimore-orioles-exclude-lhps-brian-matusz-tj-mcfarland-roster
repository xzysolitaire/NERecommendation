BALTIMORE -- The Orioles have decided to carry 11 pitchers in their AL Division Series against Detroit but have excluded left-handers Brian Matusz and T.J. McFarland, while the Tigers will have outfielder Rajai Davis on their 25-man roster. Davis has been trying to bounce back from a pelvic strain he sustained Saturday night in a game against the Twins. He did not play Sunday, and on Wednesday afternoon manager Brad Ausmus wasn't sure whether Davis would be part of the roster. But Ausmus put Davis on the roster at the deadline on Thursday morning. It is uncertain whether Davis will start or play a reserve role in the opening game Thursday. Davis hit .282 and stole 36 bases in the regular season. O's manager Buck Showalter will also do without fleet-footed Quintin Berry and infielder Alexi Casilla. Ubaldo Jimenez, who struggled for much of the season, is on a pitching staff that includes right-handed relievers Kevin Gausman and Brad Brach. Matusz went 2-3 with a 3.48 ERA in 63 games this season. He was used mostly against left-handed batters. McFarland was used mostly as a long reliever. He appeared in 37 games, going 4-2 with a 2.76 ERA. Tigers reserve infielder Hernan Perez was also included on the roster. He was called up when rosters expanded in September. The best-of-five series begins Thursday.
