ORLANDO, Fla. -- Leading scorer Arron Afflalo returned to Orlando's starting lineup in Friday night's 111-101 loss to Charlotte. Afflalo had missed three straight games with a strained right foot but scored 24 points in 38 minutes in his return. Orlando remains without starting center Nikola Vucevic, who missed his sixth consecutive game as he recovers from a concussion. Also out was reserve guard Ronnie Price, who sprained his right foot in practice.
