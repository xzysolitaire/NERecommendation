An audio recording purportedly of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks to his girlfriend is being investigated by the National Basketball Association, and the league's players past and present took to Twitter to react to Sterling's comments. Magic Johnson, who was in the since-deleted Instagram photo that led to the audio recording, said he'd no longer attend Clippers games. Jeremiah Rivers, the son of Clippers coach Doc Rivers, shared his extensive thoughts on the situation in multiple tweets. Throughout the day, multiple players added their thoughts on Sterling's comments and a potential Clippers boycott.
