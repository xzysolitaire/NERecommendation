ATLANTA -- Detroit Pistons forward Josh Smith has patella tendinitis in his left knee and did not play Tuesday against his former team, the Atlanta Hawks. Smith wore a suit and watched from the bench. It was the first game he missed since leaving Atlanta in July to sign a four-year, $54 million contract as a free agent. Smith leads the Pistons, who are eliminated from playoff contention, with a 16.4 scoring average and is second with a 6.8 rebounding average. Rodney Stuckey started in his spot. Smith was drafted No. 17 overall by his hometown Hawks in 2004. The only game Smith didn't start this season was Nov. 22 when he went scoreless in 20 minutes at Atlanta. Former coach Maurice Cheeks had benched him for missing practice.
