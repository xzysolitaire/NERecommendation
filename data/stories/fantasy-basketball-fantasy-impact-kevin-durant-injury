Looking back at Kevin Durant's seven NBA seasons, so many statistics pop out at you. There's his 27.4 career scoring average and the fact that he's connected on 88.2 percent of his free throws while getting to the line 8.4 times per game. That's merely scratching the surface. But for all of the reasons we've come to love Durant as one of the top options in fantasy hoops over the years, perhaps no stat is as important as this one: Since entering the league, the 26-year-old has played in 542 of a possible 558 regular-season games -- that's 97.1 percent -- making him one of the game's most durable stars. As you know, durability is everything in fantasy hoops, where many of the game's best players also happen to be the most fragile. That's always made Durant one of safest players to take on draft day, but that won't be the case this season thanks to the disappointing news over the weekend that he has suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot. ESPN Fantasy ranked Durant No. 1 on the fantasy basketball board this year, ahead of Stephen Curry and LeBron James, but the injury changes all that. So how many games will he miss? What can you expect from him once he returns? And, more to the point, where should you feel OK with taking him in your draft? Let's take a closer look at these very important questions.
