CLEVELAND -- A 10-story tall LeBron James could tower over downtown again. Sherwin-Williams Co. has asked the city for approval to hang a new banner of James on its headquarters across the street from Quicken Loans Arena, the Plain Dealer reported Tuesday. The banner is similar to the iconic one that was in place for years before being taken down after James signed with the Miami Heat in 2010. The city's planning commission released an image of the banner, which has a likeness of James, his arms outstretched and wearing a jersey that says "Cleveland" on the back, beneath a cloud of chalk dust, which he tossed into the air as part of his pregame ritual when he previously played for the Cavs. There is also a Nike logo in the upper right corner. James re-signed as a free agent with the Cavs this summer.
