Russian billionaire owner Mikhail Prokhorov says he has no interest in selling the Brooklyn Nets, but a league source confirmed to ESPNNewYork.com that Prokhorov is open to listening to offers for the team from potential buyers. "We have no interest in selling the team," Prokhorov said through his spokesperson on Saturday. Yahoo! Sports earlier reported of Prokhorov'sÂ willingness to listen to potential offers. The Yahoo! Sports report comes in light of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's pending $2 billion bid to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers. The report says Prokhorov at the very least is interested in gauging how much the Nets and Barclays Center could be worth on the open market, with the thought being that the Nets and their Brooklyn arena could fetch a similar sum to that of the Clippers. Prokhorov paid $223 million to become the team's majority owner in May of 2010. He owns 80 percent of the Nets and 45 percent of Barclays Center. Forbes valued the Nets at $780 million in January -- fifth-highest among NBA teams.
