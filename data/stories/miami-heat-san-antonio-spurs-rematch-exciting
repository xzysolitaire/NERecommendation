The NBA Finals are set, and it is a repeat from last year. That's right, it's Heat-Spurs Part 2, and it should be excitement galore. Miami is in its fourth straight NBA Finals -- a rare accomplishment the Heat share with the great Lakers and Celtics teams of the past. Erik Spoelstra has done a marvelous job with a very talented team, getting them to mesh and play as a unit. They have tightened up on defense in important moments, such as the final game of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers. Then there is San Antonio, led by the best coach in the NBA, Gregg Popovich. The future Hall of Famer knows how to get the most out of his players, and understands the strengths and weaknesses of his deep bench. He has pushed all the right buttons, as the Spurs got past Oklahoma City in six games. The Heat are gunning for a three-peat, which would give them another rare accomplishment in NBA history. But San Antonio, led by Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, has other ideas. Last year, the Spurs were on the verge of cutting down the nets when Ray Allen hit a stunning shot in Game 6, extending the game and series. Now the Spurs would like revenge. Kawhi Leonard, Boris Diaw, Tiago Splitter and company are ready to compete -- and they need to be for San Antonio to win. It will take more than just Parker, Duncan and Ginobili to come through. But it seems to me that Miami is a team of destiny, thanks to its big three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Wade has been healthy in the playoffs and that has made a difference. This Heat team is a lot more than just the talented trio. There is Allen, capable of making big trifectas. Udonis Haslem, Shane Battier, Chris "Birdman" Andersen, Rashard Lewis, Norris Cole and Mario Chalmers have all contributed this season. I expect an exciting series. I think San Antonio's veterans will run out of steam and King James and company will celebrate again, winning in seven games.
