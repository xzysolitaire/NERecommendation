LOS ANGELES -- J.J. Redick returned to the starting lineup for the Los Angeles Clippers for the first time in six weeks Friday night against the Los Angeles Lakers. "He made a lot of shots in practice, the last couple of practices," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "He may have been able to play against Boston [on Wednesday], but we went the extra practice with him. He's ready to play, but I didn't know if he was ready to start, but the game the other night and our second unit's inability to score told me let's get Jamal [Crawford] back in that group as soon as we can." Redick suffered a fracture in the small bone of his right hand and a tear of his right ulnar collateral ligament Nov. 29, and had not played since. He originally was expected to miss six to eight weeks. "He's a pretty conditioned athlete," Rivers said. "He's ready." The Clippers also brought in forward Hedo Turkoglu for a meeting and a workout Thursday. They liked what they saw but don't plan on signing him anytime soon. The Clippers would have to cut a player to make room for any new additions. "He made shots from everywhere," Rivers said of Turkoglu. "He looked good. It was a good workout, but we're not doing anything anytime soon, but he did look good." Rivers didn't rule out pursuing center Andrew Bynum, who was released by the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday and is expected to sign with a team soon. "I won't say. I'm playing poker right now," Rivers said. "I can't say. We do talk about everyone but I do like our team, though. I really do so I tread very cautiously with change." Clippers forward Reggie Bullock, who has been out since Dec. 7 with a sprained left ankle, is expected to return for the Clippers' game Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks.
