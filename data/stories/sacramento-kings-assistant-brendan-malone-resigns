SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Sacramento Kings assistant coach Brendan Malone has resigned. The team said it accepted Malone's resignation Wednesday, which was "based on factors associated with the rigors of coaching in the NBA.'' Malone is the father of new Kings coach Michael Malone. He has 27 years of NBA experience, including a stint as an assistant to Chuck Daly on two championship teams in Detroit. Malone also was the first head coach of the Toronto Raptors. Michael Malone said in a statement that he was thankful to have his father on staff to help him transition into his new role. He says his father "will always be an invaluable source of counsel on all matters basketball and otherwise." Chris Jent will assume Brendan Malone's responsibilities as the lead assistant.
