Atlanta Hawks center Al Horford will have surgery on his torn right pectoral muscle Tuesday and is expected to be lost for the season, the team said on Monday. Horford suffered the injury last weekend during a Hawks victory in Cleveland when he reached for a pass on defense. It is a blow for the Hawks, who had hoped to get Horford back for later in the season. In 2012, Horford tore his left pectoral muscle in January and was able to return for the playoffs that season after missing more than three months. He was having a strong season, leading the team in scoring a 18.6 points a game while averaging eight rebounds and shooting 57 percent from the floor.
