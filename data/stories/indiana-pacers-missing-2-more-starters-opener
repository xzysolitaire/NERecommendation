INDIANAPOLIS -- The short-handed Indiana Pacers will be without three more players, two of them starters, for this week's season opener. Team officials announced Monday that power forward David West and shooting guard George Hill would miss at least three games because of injuries. West is recovering from a sprained right ankle. Hill is trying to rehab from a bruised left knee. With Paul George already out with a broken right leg and Lance Stephenson playing for Charlotte, the Pacers will have four new starters in their opening day lineup. The two-time Eastern Conference runners-up also will be without point guard C.J. Watson for at least two weeks because of a bruised right foot. Indiana hosts Philadelphia on Wednesday night.
