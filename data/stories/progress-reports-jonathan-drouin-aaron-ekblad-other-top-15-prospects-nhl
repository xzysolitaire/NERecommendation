Steve Babineau/NHLI/Getty ImagesNo. 1 overall pick Aaron Ekblad has made a nearly seamless transition to the pros. We'll take a look at the progress that's been made this season by my top 15 prospects, but first, some thoughts on the impact of Connor McDavid's injury. In short, it does not affect his draft stock at all, especially now that we know he'll only be out for five to six weeks. If McDavid were going to miss a few months, even if it included the World Junior Championships, it wouldn't change his development path, nor his stock as a prospect in any sort of substantial way. He's still going to return from the injury as the clear No. 1 prospect in this year's draft class. To wit, if Alex Galchenyuk can blow out his knee, miss an entire season, and play a few games at the end of his draft year on one leg and still get picked No. 3 overall, it's obvious that a much less severe injury will have little to no impact. It would take a McDavid injury of extremely serious magnitude for Jack Eichel or Noah Hanifin to overtake him, and clearly that's not the case here.

Now, onto an update of the top 15 NHL prospects from my NHL prospect rankings this summer to see how they're fared so far this season.
