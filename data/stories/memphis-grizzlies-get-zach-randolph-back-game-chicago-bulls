CHICAGO -- Zach Randolph is back in the lineup after missing the Memphis Grizzlies' last game with the flu. The power forward sat out when Memphis lost 103-94 at Brooklyn on Wednesday night. He came to the arena in hopes of playing, but was unable to go. Memphis coach Dave Joerger says it was "just a bout of the flu," and Randolph is all set to play against the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. Randolph is averaging 17.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in 57 games.
