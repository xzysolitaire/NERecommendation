The Texas Rangers are close to bringing former player Michael Young to the organization in a front-office role, according to multiple sources. The club currently is trying to hire a manager. Pitching coach Mike Maddux and Triple-A manager Steve Buechele interviewed Tuesday for the vacant position. Tim Bogar, the favorite to get the position, took over as interim manager Sept. 5 and went 14-8. He's expected to interview soon. The Rangers' adding Young to the franchise is a positive step to bring in some former players who have ties to the current club. Young was unhappy toward the end of his time with the Rangers. After the 2010 season, he was upset at how the franchise handled his position change. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012. However, Young and the front office seem to be on good terms now. Young has been seen around the organization for several events, including the team honoring New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter in August. Young was a popular player and is considered one of the best players in Rangers history.
