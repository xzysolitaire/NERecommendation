Who will lift the NBA's ultimate individual prize in 2014-15? We asked the ESPN Forecast team to rank their top three choices for 2014-15 Most Valuable Player. Then we totaled up the ballots, with a first-place vote receiving five points, a second-place vote receiving three and a third-place vote receiving one. Now, check out the results, which we will roll out Friday one by one, here and on Twitter. To participate in the discussion and perhaps get your opinion published on this page, #ESPNForecast is the Twitter hashtag to use. Or you can just follow along @ESPNNBA.
