New Orleans Pelicans forward Ryan Anderson says he's been cleared for contact, just five months after neck surgery. Anderson, 26, had cervical spine surgery in April after suffering the injury while colliding with Gerald Wallace during a game against the Boston Celtics in January. The timetable for recovery was four to six months. He was limited to just 22 games in the 2013-14 season, averaging 19.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3.0 3-pointers per game.
