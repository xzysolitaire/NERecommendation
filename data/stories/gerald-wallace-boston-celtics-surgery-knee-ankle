WALTHAM, Mass. -- Boston Celtics forward Gerald Wallace underwent arthroscopic surgeries on his left knee and his left ankle on Tuesday morning at New England Baptist Hospital and will miss the remainder of the 2013-14 season. The surgeries were performed by Celtics team physician Dr. Brian McKeon and were assisted by Dr. Mark Slovenkai, the team announced. Wallace had been set for postseason surgery due to bone spurs in his ankle that had lingered since last season, but a recent MRI on his ailing knee revealed a torn meniscus that required more immediate attention. This is the first time Wallace has had surgery during his 13-year NBA career. "The report that I got from [team trainer] Ed Lacerte was that they did both, the ankle and the knee, and that both went well," Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Stevens said the ankle alone will sideline Wallace three to four months before he can be cleared to return to basketball activities. Wallace said last week that he hoped to be 100 percent by training camp next season. Acquired in the blockbuster swap that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to the Brooklyn Nets, Wallace averaged 5.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.3 steals in 24.4 minutes per game spanning 58 appearances. Despite initially being conflicted about joining a rebuilding process on the Celtics, Wallace reflected fondly on his first season in Boston. "The experience has been fun," Wallace said Saturday. "Losing sucks. It always does. I feel like we're a lot better than what our record shows. We've had some ups and downs, some learning curves, not only from the players, but from the coaching staff as well. Everybody learning everybody was an adjustment. But I think, for the most part, it's been a great season."
