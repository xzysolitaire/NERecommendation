Day 2 of NBA free agency 2014 brought a tiny bit more sanity to the world, although it was not without its now-prerequisite terrible contract of the day. Regardless, it was nice to see some more reasonable deals get struck. Dirk Nowitzki agreed to a new, three-year, $30 million deal in Dallas, effectively taking a more than 66 percent pay cut, while Darren Collison (three years, $16 million) and Thabo Sefolosha (three years, $12 million) came to terms with the Kings and Hawks, respectively. Here's a quick analysis of those transactions. As always, please check my Free-Agent Big Board from the start of free agency for a feel for what I deemed to be "fair market value" of the top 30 free agents. Nowitzki re-signs with the Mavs I was at the Steve Nash Charity Soccer Showdown the day before the draft, and Dirk was in attendance as one of the participants. He definitely seemed to be relaxed and at ease (although his soccer talents are probably best left not displayed), which I chalked up to the news of Tyson Chandler's return to Dallas. But in retrospect, he probably also knew he'd secure his future in a little over a week. With the new, three-year deal, Nowitzki assures he'll retire a Maverick, cementing his place as the greatest player in franchise history. The deal he signed is not far off the two-year, $25 million deal I valued him at in my Big Board and is comparable to the deals Tim Duncan has been signing over the past few years, designed to give the franchise incredible flexibility to craft a roster that can transition to the next era.
