DALLAS -- Denver Nuggets forward J.J. Hickson has a sprained right knee and will be re-evaluated before any possible return. Hickson was injured early in the fourth quarter of Denver's 122-106 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. The 25-year-old Hickson went down along the baseline, got up and went straight to the locker room with 8:10 remaining in the game. Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said the sixth-year player would be evaluated Saturday. Hickson led the Nuggets with 18 points and eight rebounds against the Mavericks. He had his season high of 22 points against them in November.
