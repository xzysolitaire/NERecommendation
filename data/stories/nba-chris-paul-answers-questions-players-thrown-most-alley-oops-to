As valuable as statistical analysis can be in the NBA, it's important to remember that numbers aren't randomly generated by a computer. They're the product of humans playing on the court. To provide that context and understand the thinking behind the stats, ESPN Insider is sitting down with NBA players for "Data Dialogues" to discuss their games and their numbers. Recently Tom Haberstroh sat down with Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul and played a little guessing game about the lob passes he's thrown over the course of his nine-year career. Tom Haberstroh: Got a game for you. Chris Paul: What game? TH: You've lobbed to 18 different players in your NBA career -- successfully thrown a lob for an alley-oop dunk. CP3: How do you know that? TH: The NBA keeps track. So, can you name the 18? CP3: OK, Chris Andersen. TH: Nope. CP3: He's gotta be on there. I played with "Bird" my first year.
