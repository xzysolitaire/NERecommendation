PITTSFORD, N.Y. -- Two Buffalo Bills players were hospitalized this week after suffering from heat-related symptoms during training camp. Tight end Chris Gragg remains in the hospital, and while fullback Evan Rodriguez was back with the team Wednesday, he did not participate in practice, coach Doug Marrone said. Both players practiced with the team Monday afternoon at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, New York, before missing practice Tuesday and Wednesday. Gragg was a seventh-round draft choice last season who played in nine games last season. Rodriguez, whom the Bills signed last November, played in seven games. They haven't been the only Bills players dealing with the heat thus far in training camp. Linebacker Brandon Spikes was brought into a cooling tent during Monday's practice, while offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson headed for the tent with trainers after Tuesday's practice.
