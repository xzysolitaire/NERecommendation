INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Pacers forward Danny Granger returned to the court Saturday night after missing most of last season with a left knee injury, finishing with six points on 2-for-10 shooting in 29 minutes during his team's 82-76 loss to the Chicago Bulls. "He was a little rusty, and I wouldn't expect anything but that," Pacers coach Frank Vogel said. "His game condition is in the final part of his recovery." Granger entered the game with 6:02 left in the first quarter. He made his first basket, a 3-pointer, with 10:54 left in the second quarter. "It was a good first step," Granger said. "My second wind didn't kick in during the first half like it usually does, but it was good to get that under my belt." Granger played in five games last season. He has a career average of 18.1 points and was an All-Star in 2009, when he averaged 25.7 points per game.
