CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Nate Chandler, in the running to become the starting left tackle for the Carolina Panthers three years after moving from the defensive line, received a three-year contract extension Wednesday. The Panthers also signed defensive end Mario Addison and safety Colin Jones to two-year extensions. Chandler, a third-year player out of UCLA, is competing with Byron Bell and Garry Williams to replace the retired Jordan Gross on the left side of Carolina's offensive line. He began Wednesday's minicamp practice with the first group. Chandler originally signed with Carolina as an undrafted free agent defensive lineman in 2012. He was cut at the end of the preseason, then re-signed to the practice squad. He was moved to the active roster in October, then switched to the offensive line in 2013 in an attempt to find a spot for him on the roster as a tackle. After losing several players to injury at guard last season, Chandler moved into the starting lineup at right guard. He started the final eight regular-season games as well as the playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers. At 6-foot-4, 315 pounds, the Panthers moved Chandler to tackle after Gross' retirement. He has spent all of offseason workouts splitting time between the left and right side. Addison is coming off his best season. He played in 16 games with two starts, collecting 14 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 15 quarterback pressures, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. Jones has been a special teams regular since Carolina signed him from San Francisco in 2012 in exchange for a seventh-round draft choice. He tied for the team lead with 10 special teams tackles last season. Details of the three deals were not immediately available.
