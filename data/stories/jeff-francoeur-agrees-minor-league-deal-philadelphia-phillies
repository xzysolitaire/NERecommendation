PHILADELPHIA -- Former Gold Glove outfielder Jeff Francoeur has agreed to a minor league contract with the Phillies. The club announced the deal Thursday along with minor league agreements for seven other players, including outfielder Xavier Paul and infielder Andres Blanco. Left-hander Elvis Araujo agreed to a one-year contract Thursday. Araujo had a 3.42 ERA and 11 saves for two minor league clubs last season. Francoeur, a first-round draft pick by Atlanta in 2002, has played for six major league clubs over 10 seasons, including 10 games last season with the San Diego Padres. He won his Gold Glove with the Braves in 2007. Francoeur has hit .262 for his big league career with 140 home runs. He hasn't played more than 100 games in the majors since 2012 with Kansas City. Francoeur and the other players were invited to Phillies big league spring training in February.
