NBA Insiders Amin Elhassan and Bradford Doolittle break down the draft profile, needs and potential picks of the 14 teams eligible for the NBA draft lottery this year. With some help from Chad Ford's Big Board, we take a look at the Los Angeles Lakers. Personnel needs: Everything Major need: There isn't a single position that the Lakers can claim as filled, with just four guaranteed contracts -- one of which is a player option for Nick Young, who is expected to decline it -- on the books. Even the most optimistic Kobe Bryant prognosis would leave the Lakers needing a shooting guard of the future to take the reins beyond Bryant's current two-year deal. Simply put, the 2014-15 Lakers need talented players, regardless of position. Quiet need: If they're all major needs, then there really aren't any needs you can call "minor."
