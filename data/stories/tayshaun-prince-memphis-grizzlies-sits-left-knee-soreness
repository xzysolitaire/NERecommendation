DALLAS -- Memphis forward Tayshaun Prince has a sore left knee and missed Wednesday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks. Prince started each of Memphis' first 24 games in his 12th NBA season. But he is shooting 25 percent (10 for 40) over his last seven games. He played just nine minutes in Tuesday's 96-92 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Mike Miller replaced Prince in the lineup against the Mavs. Miller rolled his left ankle in the loss to the Lakers. The Grizzlies already were missing point guard Mike Conley (left thigh contusion) and center Marc Gasol (sprained MCL in his left knee) from their starting lineup. Gasol did not make the trip to Dallas. Conley said he wanted to play Wednesday, but thought the extra days before Saturday's game against the New York Knicks would help. "It was so iffy," he said. "I would be playing hurt. I don't want to do anything to rush it."
