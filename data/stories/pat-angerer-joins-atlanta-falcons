The Atlanta Falcons added another body at linebacker prior to the opening of training camp Friday with the addition of veteran Pat Angerer. Angerer, 27, spent the previous four years in Indianapolis. He started 39 games with the Colts. Last year, Angerer was placed on season-ending injured reserve in December with an undisclosed knee injury. The year before, he was nagged by a foot injury. If Angerer remains healthy, he could have a chance to contribute. The Falcons had a void at inside linebacker with the loss of Sean Weatherspoon to a season-ending Achilles injury this offseason. After Weatherspoon went down, the Falcons worked out a number of veteran linebackers, including Jonathan Vilma, Nick Barnett, Tim Dobbins and Angerer. The team ended up signing Dobbins and Angerer. Paul Worrilow is set at one starting spot for the Falcons, while Joplo Bartu and rookie fourth-round pick Prince Shembo are vying to replace Weatherspoon. Angerer and Dobbins add more depth to the equation, and Dobbins is known as a special teams contributor. Angerer worked out for the Falcons on Tuesday. He was a second-round pick of the Colts in the 2010 NFL draft. The Falcons also signed wide receiver Jeremy Ebert, who worked out Tuesday. Ebert was with Jacksonville last season.
