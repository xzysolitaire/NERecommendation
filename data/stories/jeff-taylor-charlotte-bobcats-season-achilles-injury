CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte Bobcats small forward Jeff Taylor will miss the rest of the season because of a ruptured right Achilles tendon. Coach Steve Clifford said he's not sure if the tendon is completely or partially torn and won't know Taylor's recovery time until after he has surgery. However, a torn Achilles tendon typically involves between four to six months of rehabilitation. "It's unfortunate for him, especially, but also for the team," Clifford said before Saturday night's game against the Utah Jazz. "Sports are like any other business, it starts with people -- and he's a great person." Taylor, a native of Sweden, was injured in the first half of Friday night's game against the Detroit Pistons. Taylor had stepped into a starting role after Michael Kidd-Gilchrist broke his hand. He averaged 8.0 points and 2.3 rebounds in 26 games. Kidd-Gilchrist will be evaluated again on Dec. 27. Anthony Tolliver was listed as the starter for Saturday night's game for the Bobcats (13-14). "We'll go by matchups," Clifford said. "Tonight they are bigger so we will start Anthony Tolliver and then we will just take it game by game." The team recently signed Chris Douglas-Roberts to give it another option at small forward. Clifford said Gerald Henderson could also see time at the 3.
