With the college basketball season about to get underway, it's time to take a preseason look at the top NBA draft prospects by position. Last week we took a look at the bigs. This week we turn to the wings, where, again, there is a lot of talent -- especially at small forward. In fact, eight of my top 10 really qualify as full-time small forwards. In a league where shooting guard is a need for so many teams, the lack of 2s is a bit of a problem. It's worth reminding college basketball fans that this isn't a list of the best players in college by position; it's the best NBA prospects. In many cases, those two lists don't align precisely. Insider spoke with a number of NBA general managers and scouts in an attempt to aggregate the rankings. Expect them to change as the season progresses. We'll try to come back each month with an update. Here are the top 10 wing prospects for 2015: 1. Kelly Oubre, G/F, Fr., Kansas Top 100 Rank: 5 Oubre is using a terrific summer to push his stock into the top five. Blessed with deep range on his jump shot, terrific size for his position and elite athletic abilities, he's a very special talent. Improved decision-making and a midrange game are the things scouts will look for this season. He can be a gunslinger, and it remains to be seen whether head coach Bill Self can rein him in.
