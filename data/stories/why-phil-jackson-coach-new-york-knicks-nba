It's been a little over a week since the New York Knicks were spurned by Steve Kerr, resetting Phil Jackson's head-coaching search to the beginning. While there isn't necessarily an urgency to make a hire before the draft, Jackson needs to have this wrapped up before the league's annual moratorium on most transactions begins on July 1. That's the date that Carmelo Anthony can become a free agent, and if he's going to stick with the Knicks, he's going to want to know what he's getting into. At this point, no matter who Jackson brings in will not only be faced with implementing Jackson's beloved on-court systems with the man himself hovering nearby, but he'll have to do so knowing that he wasn't the anointed one. After chewing on this for a week, my knee-jerk reaction has coalesced into a full-blown stance: The only real way for Jackson and the Knicks to save face is for him to coach the team himself. This has probably been his best option all along. To read the complete article about why it makes sense for Phil Jackson to coach the Knicks, become an Insider.
