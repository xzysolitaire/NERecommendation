Veteran power forward Udonis Haslem has opted out of his deal with the Miami Heat and will become an unrestricted free agent, according to a report. Bleacher Report reported Saturday that Haslem did not exercise his $4.62 million player option and now is free to sign with any team -- including re-signing a team-friendly deal with the Heat to create extra space under the salary cap -- starting Tuesday. LeBron James has already opted out of his deal with the Heat, and Dwyane Wade followed suit on Saturday. Chris Bosh -- who, like Wade, has the same representation as Haslem -- has until midnight on Monday to make the same decision. James, Bosh and Wade met Wednesday over a meal to discuss their futures, sources told ESPN.com. If all re-sign with the Heat, team president Pat Riley would have more financial flexibility with which to work to lure other free agents. The Heat have been to the Finals the past four seasons, winning two titles. Haslem has spent 11 NBA seasons with the Heat, but averaged 3.8 points and 3.8 rebounds over 14.2 minutes per game this season -- all career lows.
