EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Brooklyn Nets guard Jorge Gutierrez received his first multiyear contract on Friday -- just in time to pay his first fine. The NBA announced that Gutierrez had been docked $15,000 for "making excessive contact above the shoulders" with Charlotte Bobcats center Cody Zeller in Wednesday night's game. He'd been assessed a flagrant 2 on the play, which came with 6:42 left in the fourth quarter of visiting Brooklyn's 116-111 overtime loss and resulted in his automatic ejection. Gutierrez, whose second 10-day contract had expired, told reporters his deal encompasses the remainder of this season and all of next (non-guaranteed). In five games with the Nets, Gutierrez has averaged 3.4 points in 13.4 minutes and shot 61.5 percent from the field. Before getting thrown out of Wednesday night's game, he had six points on 3-for-3 shooting in a season-high 19 minutes. Gutierrez, 25, was with the Nets in training camp before getting cut.
