MINNEAPOLIS -- The game between the San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves that was originally scheduled to be played in Mexico City on Dec. 4 will now be played in Minnesota on April 8. The league made the announcement on Monday. The game was postponed in December when a generator malfunctioned and filled the arena in Mexico City with smoke about 45 minutes before tipoff. The game was part of the NBA's ongoing efforts to increase the league's international reach. But logistics and scheduling prevented the league from replaying the game in Mexico City. The Timberwolves were giving up a home game to be a part of the event, so the league moved the game back to Target Center. Season ticket holders will be given priority to purchase tickets for the game.
