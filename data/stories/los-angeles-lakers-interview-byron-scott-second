Byron Scott met with the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday to discuss the team's vacant coaching position for the second time, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. Scott met with vice president of player personnel Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak. Thus far, he is the only candidate to be interviewed twice by the Lakers. While Scott is a clear front-runner, sources said talks have not escalated to the point where the sides are discussing contractual terms. Scott, a former longtime Laker who played with Kobe Bryant during Bryant's rookie season, has spoken with Bryant several times throughout the Lakers' coaching search.
