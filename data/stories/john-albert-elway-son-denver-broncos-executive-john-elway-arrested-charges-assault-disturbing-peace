DENVER -- Jack Elway, the son of Denver Broncos executive John Elway, has been arrested on charges of assault and disturbing the peace. John Albert Elway, 24, was booked into jail early Saturday morning after an incident near a college campus in downtown Denver, according to jail records. Police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez said she could not provide any details about what led to the arrest, other than the alleged victim was a female. "This is a personal family matter and the Broncos will not have any additional comment on it," Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth said. Elway was released on $550 bond and was scheduled to appear in court Thursday. Jail records do not indicate if he has an attorney. Jack Elway was a standout quarterback at Cherry Creek High School in Englewood, Colorado, before choosing to play at Arizona State. As a redshirt freshman quarterback in spring 2009, he elected to leave the Sun Devils' football program. John Elway led the Broncos to two Super Bowl titles in his Hall of Fame career.
