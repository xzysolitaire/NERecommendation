Slugger Giancarlo Stanton and the Miami Marlins are discussing a long-term contract in the $300 million range, sources confirmed to ESPN on Thursday. FoxSports.com first reported terms of the deal. The Marlins have made locking up Stanton a priority this offseason, with president of baseball operations Mike Hill saying earlier this week that the team had begun discussions with agent Joel Wolfe regarding an agreement with the All-Star right fielder. Stanton, who has 154 career homers at age 25, doesn't become a free agent until after the 2016 season. Stanton's 2014 season ended Sept. 11 when he was hit in the face by a pitch. Despite missing the final 17 games, he led the NL with 37 homers and a .555 slugging percentage for the Marlins, who went 77-85 but ended a three-year streak of last-place finishes in the NL East. Stanton finished second in NL MVP voting on Thursday. The last time the historically thrifty Marlins spent big was before a poor 2012 season, the first in their new ballpark. Their 2014 payroll of $52.3 million was the lowest in the majors. That figure is expected to rise next year, but Hill declined to offer specifics earlier this week.
