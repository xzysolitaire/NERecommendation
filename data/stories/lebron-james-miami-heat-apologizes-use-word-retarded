MIAMI -- LeBron James of the Miami Heat apologized Wednesday night for using the word "retarded" while answering a question posed in a pregame interview. James says the word's usage is a bad habit that he's trying to break, and that he'll try not to use it again. "I mean no disrespect," James said. The NBA's four-time Most Valuable Player opened his postgame interview session by addressing the matter without being asked. James and the Heat lost Wednesday to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 112-95.
