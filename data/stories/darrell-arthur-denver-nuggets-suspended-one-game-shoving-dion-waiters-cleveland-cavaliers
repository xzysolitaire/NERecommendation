NEW YORK -- Denver Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur has been suspended one game without pay for shoving Cleveland Cavaliers guard Dion Waiters in the back as he went up for a layup. NBA president of basketball operations Rod Thorn made the announcement in a news release Saturday night. The play occurred Friday night with 4.4 seconds remaining in the first quarter of Cleveland's 110-101 victory in Denver. Arthur was called for a flagrant 2 foul and ejected. The league says he will serve his suspension Sunday when the Nuggets play at Portland.
