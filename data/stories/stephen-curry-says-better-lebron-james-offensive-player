Stephen Curry took a shot at King James' throne Tuesday. The Golden State Warriors point guard picked himself when asked whether he or LeBron James was the better offensive player. "A better offensive player, me or LeBron? That's the first time I've ever been asked that question. Me," Curry said, in an interview on "The Dan Patrick Show." "He obviously demands a lot of attention on the floor, but I like to say I can distribute, get my teammates involved and be a playmaker as well." Curry led James this past season in assists per game with 8.5, which was fifth in the league, while LeBron was 11th with 6.4. Curry also had an advantage in 3-pointers with 261 -- 38 more than any other player in the league -- to James' 116 and in 3-point field goal shooting (42.4 percent to 37.9 percent). However, James had the edge in points per game, ranking third in the league at 27.1, while Curry was seventh at 24.0. And James led Curry in field goal shooting (56.7 percent to 47.1 percent). Both players were in the top 10 in player efficiency rating, with James second at 29.40 and Curry 10th at 24.13.
