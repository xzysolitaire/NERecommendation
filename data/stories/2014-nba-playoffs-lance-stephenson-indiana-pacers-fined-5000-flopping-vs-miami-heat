NEW YORK -- The NBA has fined Indiana's Lance Stephenson $5,000 for flopping in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals. Stephenson was chasing Miami's LeBron James as James dribbled up the court in the third quarter of Tuesday's game. Stephenson lightly bumped into James, then fell backward to the court as if it had been a real collision. Stephenson was also fined in last year's series against the Heat, the first year the NBA began penalizing players for the act of exaggerating contact to fool referees into calling fouls.
