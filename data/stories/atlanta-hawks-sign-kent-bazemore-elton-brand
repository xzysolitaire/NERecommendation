ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Hawks have signed free-agent guard Kent Bazemore and re-signed forward-center Elton Brand. The 6-foot-5 Bazemore played for Golden State and the Los Angeles Lakers last season. After he was acquired by the Lakers on Feb. 13, he averaged 13.1 points in 23 games, including 15 starts. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said Tuesday the 25-year-old Bazemore is versatile, especially on defense, where he can guard multiple positions. Bazemore was undrafted out of Old Dominion. Budenholzer calls the 35-year-old Brand "the ultimate professional and a terrific leader." He averaged 5.7 points and 4.9 rebounds last season, when he started 15 of his 73 games. Terms of the deals were not announced.
