NOBLESVILLE, Ind. -- A court has suspended Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay's driver's license for one year following his arrest for driving while intoxicated. The Indianapolis Star reports that recently released documents in Hamilton County confirm the license suspension effective starting May 27. Police and prosecutors have declined to discuss the case. Irsay refused a blood test after his March 16 arrest in Carmel, a suburb of Indianapolis. Indiana law requires a one-year license suspension for refusing such a test. Police later obtained a warrant ordering Irsay to submit to a blood draw. Irsay faces a June 19 initial hearing on two misdemeanor counts of impaired driving. A probable cause affidavit said Irsay was driving under the influence of powerful painkillers. A message seeking comment was left with a spokeswoman for Irsay.
