SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Southern California was just jammed full of NBA prospects last week. On Friday we talked about Gary Harris, James Young and company. On Tuesday we detailed the workouts of Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid and Jabari Parker. But that's not all. On Friday, I saw several other intriguing prospects for the 2014 NBA draft in workouts in Santa Monica. All of these workouts were also in front of a plethora of NBA scouts and general managers. Here's a look at how each of the top prospects fared. Aaron Gordon, Arizona Wildcats Gordon is riding a high from an excellent NBA draft combine, where he tested among the top athletes at the event. However, that didn't really surprise anyone who has followed Gordon's career. We all know that he can jump out of the gym. Friday's test was more crucial. Gordon has been labeled as a tweener by many NBA scouts -- a tad too small to be an effective power forward but too limited offensively to be an NBA small forward. That's why Gordon, who's 6-foot-9, 225 pounds, has spent the season trying to prove he can make the transition offensively to the small forward position. His freshman season at Arizona was a mixed bag on that front. While he shot a surprising 36 percent from 3-point range (albeit with a very small sample size) his 2-point jump shooting was an abysmal 27.5 percent, and he shot a horrific 42 percent from the free throw line.
