NEW YORK -- The woman Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was caught on tape talking to when he made racist remarks says she was assaulted by two men outside a New York City hotel. Police say V. Stiviano spoke to detectives on Monday and told them the assault happened outside the Gansevoort Hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District on Sunday night. Police say Stiviano said there was an exchange of words and she was punched in the side of the face. Police say they're investigating the possibility the unidentified men used racial slurs during the attack. Stiviano is of black and Mexican descent. Mac Nehoray, Stiviano's attorney, confirmed to ESPNNewYork.com that Stiviano was leaving a restaurant by the Gansevoort Hotel when the two men punched her several times on the right side of the face. Her attorneys released a statement saying Stiviano  was getting inside a cab when the men assaulted and threatened her. Stiviano was in New York for an interview with CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360," which was canceled.  Stiviano's audio recording of the Clippers owner led to his being banned from the NBA. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has agreed to buy the Clippers for $2 billion.
