NEW YORK -- The NBA fined Indiana Pacers forward Paul George $25,000 on Tuesday for his public criticism of the officiating in the Eastern Conference finals Game 4 loss to Miami. Rod Thorn, the league's president of basketball operations, said George made his comments in the postgame news conference following the 102-90 loss to the Heat on Monday night. Miami was 30 of 34 from the foul line in the game. Indiana was 11 of 17. George said his team couldn't overcome a "20-point differential" that came through foul calls. He said Miami won the game at the free throw line.
