Browns wide receiever Josh Gordon, facing a one-year suspension, has hired attorney Maurice Suh, who helped Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman win his appeal of a contested positive test, a league source said. Suh will work alongside NFLPA attorney Heather McPhee, who has an excellent reputation in league circles, to try to help salvage as much of this season as possible for Cleveland's Pro Bowl wide receiver. At the very least, Gordon has recognized how important it is to have such strong legal representation. Gordon began working with Suh earlier this month in preparation of an appeal that has been scheduled for Friday. McPhee has been on the case all along. McPhee and Suh -- a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, in Los Angeles -- helped Sherman avoid a suspension when they argued that a cup with a broken seal was used during Sherman's urine test. At the time, Suh released a statement saying: "We are very pleased that the hearing officer recognized that the egregious errors that occurred with Mr. Sherman's collection required overturning the NFL's discipline. Mr. Sherman provided honest testimony about a severely flawed process, and the hearing officer found him to be a credible man. We couldn't be happier for Richard, and we were thrilled to help him and the union present a very strong case."
