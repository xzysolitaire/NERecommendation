LAS VEGAS -- Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers says he trusts player Blake Griffin, and a police investigation of a man's complaint that Griffin attacked him during an argument over a photo at a Las Vegas Strip nightclub shouldn't distract the team. The Clippers issued a statement from Rivers before the team's home exhibition game against the Phoenix Suns. He says he's very confident things will work out. No arrest was immediately made while Las Vegas police investigate a battery complaint filed Sunday stemming from what a department spokesman called an altercation over a camera.
