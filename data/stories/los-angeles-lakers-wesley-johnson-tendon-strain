EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Wesley Johnson underwent an MRI on Monday that revealed he has a strained tendon in his left foot. Johnson was held out of practice Monday, and the Lakers are calling his status day to day. The Lakers play the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday in Ontario, Calif., in their third preseason game of the exhibition schedule. The fourth-year forward exited the Lakers' 97-88 loss to the Nuggets on Sunday with 3:59 remaining in the first quarter after feeling a "burning sensation" in his foot, according to Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni. Johnson finished with only two points and three rebounds while shooting 1-for-5 from the field with two turnovers. It was Johnson's second straight underwhelming performance of the preseason, at least statistically, after being considered a breakout player during training camp. "It could be two bad games, it could be just whatever," D'Antoni said. "I told him today, if you look at the film -- and I don't think he's played well up to his potential -- but with him on the floor, we're a better team. He makes us better. So, that should be comforting that he doesn't have to press. But, we'll see. I think going forward, he'll get his rhythm." In other injury news for the Lakers, Jordan Farmar (sore calf) practiced Monday after sitting out Sunday, and Kobe Bryant was away from the team for the fifth consecutive day after traveling to Germany on Wednesday to undergo a procedure on his right knee. Late Monday night, Bryant posted a photo of his knee on his Instagram account. He also wrote this: "In case u were wondering.. #germany #fyi" "When he's ready to roll, he's ready to go," D'Antoni said of Bryant. The coach was asked whether he has had any contact with the Lakers' star guard during Bryant's trip. "No, I don't have the international [calling] plan," D'Antoni joked.
