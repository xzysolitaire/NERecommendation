LeBron James has signed with Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor to develop film and entertainment projects, a source familiar with the deal told ESPN.com. The news was earlier reported by the Hollywood Reporter. James is rapidly expanding his off-court interest in entertainment. Within the past year he's signed on to produce a comedy for the Starz channel and is developing a movie with comedian Kevin Hart. There were reports in February that James was being considered as a star for a "Space Jam 2" project Warner Bros. was working on. James shot down that idea at the time and he's still not connected to the project, the source said. The move ends James' relationship with Creative Artists Agency, which he dropped as his basketball representation in 2012. He is represented by Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group for basketball, Fenway Sports Group and LRMR Marketing for endorsement deals and now WME for entertainment deals. James has dabbled in acting, mostly playing versions of himself in Nike commercials or cameos in series like "Entourage." He was a producer of a 2008 documentary called "More Than a Game" about his high school team. He's had several other entertainment projects that did not come to fruition. James' Starz series, called "Survivor's Remorse," is about a star athlete who has trouble connecting with his old life. It recently finished casting and is set to film this summer in Atlanta and debut this fall with six episodes. James plans to star with Hart in a movie called "Ballers" with Imagine Entertainment about the less-talented brother of an NBA star. The project is in development with Hart planning to write the script.
