LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Clippers waived Carlos Delfino and Miroslav Raduljica just three days after trading for both players, the team announced Friday. On Tuesday the Clippers traded Jared Dudley and a protected first-round pick in 2017 for Delfino and Raduljica, but it was a move intended to create roster and salary-cap flexibility. Delfino and Raduljica were waived using the stretch provision, freeing up $3.5 million for the Clippers to sign players to veteran's minimum contracts. The Clippers had until Sunday to waive both players under the provision that will stretch out the remaining salaries of Delfino and Raduljica over five years. After the moves, the Clippers now have 11 players under contract for next season, two below the league minimum. The Clippers will be bringing in veteran players for workouts, and Clippers coach Doc Rivers has been in contact with Ray Allen, who is in the process of deciding if he wants to return for a 20th season. The 39-year-old free agent, who won an NBA title with Rivers while they were in Boston for five seasons, is also being courted by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
