In a move that was largely expected, the Arizona Cardinals placed second-year safety Tyrann Mathieu on the physically unable to perform list two days before they report to training camp, the team announced. Mathieu is still recovering from a torn LCL and ACL suffered in Week 13 of last season. He'll be allowed to participate in team meetings but can't practice with the Cardinals during training camp at University of Phoenix Stadium as long as he's on the PUP list. Nose tackle Alameda Ta'amu, who suffered a torn ACL in Week 17 last season, also was placed on the list. Mathieu's return was undetermined, with a slew of prognoses floated during the offseason ranging from a return on "Monday Night Football" in Week 1 to October. This move is an indication that he likely won't be back for the season opener. The difference between being on the preseason and regular-season PUP list is significant. Once Mathieu is cleared to play during the preseason, he can be immediately activated. If he's eventually placed on the regular-season PUP list, he'll have to wait until at least Week 6 to return to the field. Mathieu had 63 tackles, two interceptions and a sack while starting 11 of 13 games as a rookie.
