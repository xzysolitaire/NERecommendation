HOUSTON -- There is no timetable for Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard's return after he underwent platelet-rich plasma therapy to treat his strained right knee, coach Kevin McHale said before Saturday night's 95-92 win against the Dallas Mavericks. It was the second consecutive game missed by Howard, who warmed up before Wednesday's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers before it was determined minutes before tip-off that he could not play. Howard underwent the PRP therapy, a cutting-edge technique that Kobe Bryant used in 2013, on Thursday. "It feels a lot better," Howard said Friday, according to the Houston Chronicle. "I had to get a shot in it to clear some of the stuff out of it. I'm trying to do whatever I can to get back on the floor." PRP places a patient's blood in a centrifuge and spins it to separate the platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the injured tissue. It is generally used for long-term treatment, although Howard expressed hope that he wouldn't be sidelined for an extended period. Howard, an eight-time All-Star, averaged 18.8 points, 11.3 rebounds and 3.2 blocks in the Rockets' first 10 games. Undrafted rookie Tarik Black started in his absence, collecting three points and seven rebounds.
