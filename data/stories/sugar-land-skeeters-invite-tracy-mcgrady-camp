SUGAR LAND, Texas -- Retired NBA star Tracy McGrady is moving closer to his dream of playing professional baseball. The Sugar Land Skeeters have invited the 34-year-old McGrady to spring training, giving him a chance to earn a spot on the independent Atlantic League team. A seven-time NBA All-Star, McGrady has been training to become a pitcher with the team. "We're intrigued by the progress Tracy has made thus far and really commend him for putting in the work," Skeeters manager Gary Gaetti said. The 6-foot-8 right-hander played baseball from age 5 until his senior year in high school, when he transferred to a school without a baseball program. Seven-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens pitched for the Skeeters a couple of years ago.
