NEW YORK -- Mark Tatum will become the NBA's new deputy commissioner when Adam Silver succeeds David Stern on Saturday. NBA owners unanimously approved the appointment of Tatum, a 15-year veteran of the league office, on Thursday. He will also have the title of chief operations officer. Tatum is the NBA's executive vice president of global marketing partnerships. He has overseen the league's marketing partnership business and also was responsible for managing the league's media sales. The graduate of Cornell and the Harvard Business School joined the NBA in 1999, having previously worked at the Clorox Company, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi and Major League Baseball. Silver said in a statement the appointment recognizes the "confidence our owners and teams have in his leadership ability and track record of success." He added that Tatum will "use his extensive industry relationships and knowledge of our game to help guide and grow our league." Silver has been deputy commissioner since 2006. Stern is retiring after 30 years as commissioner. The NBA also announced three other promotions that take effect Saturday. Bill Koenig will become president of global media distribution; Sal LaRocca will be president of global operations and merchandising; and Danny Meiseles will be president and executive producer of content. All three began working at the NBA in 1990. "Together, these executives have led their respective areas in a way that has earned them accolades from their colleagues and the industry," Silver said.
