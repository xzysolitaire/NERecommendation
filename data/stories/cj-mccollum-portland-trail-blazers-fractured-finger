PORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum fractured his right index finger during Monday night's victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. The Blazers did not say when McCollum was expected to return, but he will be re-evaluated in four weeks. McCollum broke his finger when he grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled by Eric Gordon in the fourth quarter. The second-year guard was averaging 5 points, 1.1 assists and 1.1 rebounds in 13.1 minutes per game so far this season for Portland.
