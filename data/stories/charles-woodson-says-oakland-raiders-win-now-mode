The free-agent additions to the Oakland Raiders' roster have veteran safety Charles Woodson thinking big. "We're not looking to build for next year," Woodson told reporters Wednesday after arriving at the Napa Valley Marriott. "We're looking to win now. I look forward to going in this week and getting started and work toward the ultimate goal." The Raiders finished 4-12 last season and haven't played a playoff game since 2002 when they lost in the Super Bowl to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But general manager Reggie McKenzie used the offseason to add several veteran players to the roster. Running back Maurice Jones-Drew, defensive ends Justin Tuck and Antonio Smith, linebacker LaMarr Woodley, wide receiver James Jones, cornerbacks Tarell Brown and Carlos Rogers and offensive linemen Donald Penn and Austin Howard were among the players to sign with the Raiders, who also made a trade for quarterback Matt Schaub. "As I look at the way it was built, solidifying the interior of the offensive and defensive line, bringing in a veteran quarterback, running backs like Darren McFadden and Maurice Jones-Drew, plus guys who can rush on the defensive side, there's no reason we can't win a lot of games," Woodson told reporters. "I'm looking forward to building with the guys, getting better and making our run." Owner Mark Davis also expects the Raiders to be better this season, telling the Bay Area News Group earlier this week that "there are no more excuses" for his team.
