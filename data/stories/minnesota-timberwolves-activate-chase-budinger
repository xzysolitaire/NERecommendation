MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have activated forward Chase Budinger for the first time this season. Budinger was activated Wednesday before the Wolves hosted the Phoenix Suns. He missed the first 34 games of the season after having surgery on a torn meniscus in his left knee before the preseason. Budinger was signed this summer to a three-year, $15 million deal even after he missed much of last season with a similar injury. Budinger tore the meniscus again during workouts in August and had surgery to remove part of it in September. Coach Rick Adelman says Budinger will be limited to 15-20 minutes as he begins working his way back. The Wolves are hoping his outside shooting and ability to move without the ball will help stabilize a struggling second unit.
