CenterÂ Marcin Gortat will re-sign with the Washington Wizards, ESPN.com's Marc Stein confirmed Tuesday night. News of the deal was first tweeted by Wizards point guard John Wall. Gortat agreed to a five-year deal worth a fully guaranteed $60 million, with neither a player nor a team option entering the final season. The deal can't officially be signed until July 10 when the league moratorium is lifted. But Wall broke the news of the agreement: Gortat also took to Twitter on Tuesday night. The 30-year-old Gortat averaged 13.2 points and 9.5 rebounds per game last season, his first with the Wizards.
