ORLANDO, Fla. --Â Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio left Friday night's game against the Orlando Magic with a sprained left ankle after landing awkwardly on a drive to the basket in the second quarter. X-rays were negative, and Rubio will be re-evaluated Saturday in Miami, where the Timberwolves play the Heat to end their three-game road trip. "He popped it pretty good," Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said after Minnesota's 112-103 overtime loss to Orlando. "So we'll have to wait to see where it's at tomorrow. "It swelled up high. You're always concerned about the possibility with high ankle-type sprain. We'll know more tomorrow. I know that Ricky, he'll do whatever he has to do to try to get back. He has an unbelievable work ethic." Rubio was seen leaving the arena's examination room on crutches and with the left ankle heavily wrapped. He was not available to talk to the media after the game. The injury occurred with just over two minutes left in the second quarter, when Magic defenders Willie Green, Elfrid Payton and Nikola Vucevic converged on Rubio as he drove toward the basket. Rubio rolled his ankle drastically as he planted his left foot to jump into the air. He immediately grabbed the ankle and rolled over onto his back in pain as trainers arrived onto the court. Severe swelling was visible from courtside before Rubio was carried away. He had four points and six assists in 13 minutes before the injury. Mo Williams replaced him, scoring four points with seven assists in 31 minutes. The injury came seven days after Rubio signed a four-year, $55 million extension with the Timberwolves. He was averaging 10.8 points and 11 assists through Minnesota's first four games of the season.
