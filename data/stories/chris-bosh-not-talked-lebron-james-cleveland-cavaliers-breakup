Miami Heat center Chris Bosh raised some eyebrows Tuesday when he said he hasn't talked to LeBron James since he returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bosh made the revelation as he was asked about the Heat's game against the Cavaliers on Saturday when Bosh and Dwyane Wade will take the court for the first time against James, who decided to break up Miami's "Big Three" by returning to his native Ohio this offseason. Bosh and Wade, who were also free agents, chose to return to Miami. Asked by reporters if he had talked to his former teammate since James' decision to leave the Heat, Bosh answered a succinct, "No." As to whether he was looking forward to seeing James on Saturday at the game in Rio de Janeiro, he replied with a lukewarm, "Yeah ... I don't know." "I'm in the mode where I'm trying to lead my team, help these guys out around here," he said.Â  "If guys aren't in this locker room, I don't have much time for them -- if any." The Heat's first "real" game against James and the Cavaliers is scheduled for Christmas Day. Bosh said he's focused on his teammates in the present, not the past. "Everybody's going to hype it up, and it's going to be a big deal,'' Bosh said. "But for us, it's just another opportunity to get better. We know everything that's surrounding the situation, and it is what it is. As far as we're concerned, this is our team, this is what we're trying to build toward, the past is the past, we're moving on, and it's good to get this out of the way.''
