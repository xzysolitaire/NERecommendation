Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward generated buzz this summer when Utah matched a four-year, $63 million offer sheet from the Charlotte Hornets in order to keep him in a Jazz uniform. The reaction was understandable -- spending more than $15 million per season on a player like Hayward who was coming off his worst shooting season in four years as a pro seemed like a lot, especially for a rebuilding team like the Jazz. Interestingly, though, while Utah showed a willingness to invest in the player it drafted No. 9 overall in 2010, fantasy owners weren't as quick to target the swingman in their leagues this season. His average draft position in ESPN leagues was 47. Today, three weeks into the season, so much has already changed. Hayward, who added strength and bulked up over the offseason, has benefited from Quin Snyder's new offensive system and rediscovered his shooting stroke in the process. He enters Tuesday's game against Oklahoma City ranked No. 6 on ESPN's Player Rater, trailing onlyÂ Anthony Davis, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Nikola Vucevic. Going forward, the question now for many Hayward fantasy owners is whether to sell high on Utah's budding star or ride out his production and hope it can continue all season long. I reached out to the team of ESPN Insiders for their take on Hayward and a number of other hot-starting "sell-high" candidates around the league who are currently much higher on the Player Rater than their ADP would have forecast. After crunching the numbers and weighing the early trends, here are the players you should keep for the long haul and the ones you should trade before their value drops.
