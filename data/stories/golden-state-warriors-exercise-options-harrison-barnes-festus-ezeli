OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Golden State Warriors have picked up the fourth-year options on the contracts of forward Harrison Barnes and center Festus Ezeli for next season. The Warriors also announced Thursday night that they declined the third-year option on guard Nemanja Nedovic's deal for next season. He was the only player on the active roster who did not play in Golden State's season-opening 95-77 win at Sacramento on Wednesday night. Barnes is averaging 9.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists. Ezeli played in 79 games, including 41 starts, as a rookie before missing last season recovering from surgery on his right knee. The Warriors acquired Nedovic in a draft-night deal with Phoenix, who selected the Serbian guard 30th overall. He appeared in 24 games last season, averaging 1.1 points and 5.9 minutes.
