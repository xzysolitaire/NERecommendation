Allen Einstein/NBAE/Getty ImagesWhile Andre Drummond is evolving into a franchise center, the Pistons have a lot of holes elsewhere. NBA Insiders Amin Elhassan and Bradford Doolittle break down the draft profile, needs and potential picks of the 14 teams eligible for the NBA draft lottery this year. With some help from Chad Ford's Big Board, we take a look at the Detroit Pistons. Note: The Pistons have no picks this year, but we offer a complete rundown of roster strengths and weaknesses and possible offseason moves. Personnel needs: PG, SG, SF Major need: Newly minted President of Basketball Ops/head coach Stan Van Gundy has his hands full with an incongruent roster that last season struggled on both ends of the floor. Detroit was the second-worst team in the league in terms of 3-point percentage, which almost criminally compacts space around big-man wunderkind Andre Drummond. Finding starting-caliber wing players who can space the floor is a must. Quiet need: This need isn't so quiet, but the point guard position needs to be re-addressed. Despite the praises of Joe Dumars last offseason, Brandon Jennings was not the savior the Pistons expected, and while Van Gundy will speak optimistically about every player having the opportunity to start fresh, it's hard to imagine Jennings being the answer for Detroit.
