Michael Jordan named his unbeatable pickup team and revealed one of his favorite dunks in a promotional video he did for a video game. The former Chicago Bulls star chose teammate Scottie Pippen, Los Angeles Lakers James Worthy and Magic Johnson and Houston Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon as his teammates in a pickup game. "I got no chance of losing. None at all," he said in the video released by 2K Sports to promote "NBA 2K14." Of the many poster-worthy dunks in his career, Jordan singled out his slam on Patrick Ewing in the 1991 playoffs as one of his favorites. Jordan did a quick spin away from Charles Oakley on the baseline, soared to the hoop and put down a one-hand slam in the face of Ewing's challenge. Jordan said he thinks about that one "very, very often." "I told him, Georgetown guys don't block shots, they take charges," Jordan said on the video. "I dunked it on him so hard it was unbelievable. Every time I see him, that's the first thing I remind him of." Jordan also mentioned his 1997 dunk on Dikembe Mutombo that ended with MJ waving his finger just as the Atlanta Hawks center used to do after blocks. Jordan said that the 1995-96 season was his best. He played in only 17 games the previous season after returning from a failed stint in minor league baseball, and some questioned whether he would be the same player. But Jordan averaged a league-high 30.4 points and led the Bulls to an NBA record 72-10 regular season and his fourth of six championships.
