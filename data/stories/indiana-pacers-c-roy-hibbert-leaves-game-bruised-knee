INDIANAPOLIS -- Pacers center Roy Hibbert bruised his left knee during Indiana's 97-90 loss to the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. The Pacers originally listed Hibbert's return as questionable, but announced in the third quarter that he would not return. Hibbert left the court with 56 seconds to play in the first quarter. It was unclear how he was injured. He had four points and three rebounds at the time when he left. The Pacers were already missing several key players with injury or illness, including David West, Paul George, George Hill, C.J. Miles, Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Watson.
