INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel used his regular starters Sunday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Vogel benched all of five of his starters Wednesday at Milwaukee, saying his team looked worn down and needed rest. The starters returned to the court in Friday night's loss at Miami. But less than two hours before Sunday's tip, Vogel said he would not bench anyone against the Thunder. Miami lost Saturday night at Atlanta, dropping them into a tie with Indiana atop the Eastern Conference standings and giving the Pacers the inside track to the top seed because they own the tiebreaker based on a better conference record.
