SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento Kings say power forward Carl Landry is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for next season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. The team says Dr. David Altchek at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York performed the surgery Thursday. Landry signed a $26 million, four-year contract with the Kings in July after helping the Golden State Warriors reach the second round of the playoffs last year. But he played just 18 games this season after injuries to his left hip flexor and right knee, averaging 4.2 points and 3.2 rebounds in 12.9 minutes.
