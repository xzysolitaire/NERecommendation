INDIANAPOLIS -- The first NBA draft scouting event of the season happened on Tuesday night, when four elite teams met in Indianapolis as part of the Champions Classic. In the first game of the night, Duke defeated Michigan State 81-71. In the nightcap, Kentucky annihilated Kansas 72-40. By my count, six lottery picks, nine players in our Top 30 and 21 players in our Top 100 were on the court Tuesday night. That's a little less than half the lottery and 30 percent of the first round. NBA GMs and scouts were out in force to get their first look at some elite players this season. First impressions (while often terribly misleading) really matter. Some players made great ones while others came up very short. I attended the Champions Classic on Tuesday, and in addition to watching the players play, I spoke with a number of NBA GMs and scouts during and after the game. Here's a look at who helped and who hurt their draft stock on Tuesday night.
