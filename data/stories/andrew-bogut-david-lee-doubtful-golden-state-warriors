DALLAS -- The Golden State Warriors arrived at the American Airlines Center with a drastically depleted frontcourt. Center Andrew Bogut didn't make the trip due to a pelvis/groin contusion. Power forward David Lee is doubtful because of a strained right hamstring. That takes 25.1 points and 19.5 rebounds per game out of Golden State's starting lineup. Bogut, the Warriors' defensive anchor, has averaged a double-double against Dallas in his career and 9.7 points and 12.7 rebounds against the Mavs this season. Lee has averaged 13.7 points and 11.3 rebounds in the three games between the teams this season, two of which the Warriors have won. Jermaine O'Neal and Marreese Speights are penciled in as fill-in starters, but the Mavs expect to see a lot of small ball from the Warriors. "We'll be scrambling around chasing smaller guys around, which is hard, too," Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. "In many ways, it's harder." Carlisle specifically mentioned a lineup of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes as one the Mavs must be prepared to face. "They'd have five guys who can make a 3 or put it on the floor," Carlisle said. "And they're all good defensively. Golden State hasn't used that group together often. But it's been effective, lighting it up for 92 points and outscoring opponents by 21 in the 35 minutes that five has been on the floor together this season. "When we go small, we can match up pretty well with them," said the 6-foot-7 Shawn Marion, who plays power forward or sometimes center in Mavs' small lineups. "They can be a little faster, a little bit more athletic than us. We've got to use our savviness and our craftiness."
