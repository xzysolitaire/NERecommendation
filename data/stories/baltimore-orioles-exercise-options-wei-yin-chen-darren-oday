BALTIMORE -- The Orioles have exercised a $4.75 million option on left-hander Wei-Yin Chen and a $4.25 million option on right-hander Darren O'Day. Chen, 29, was 16-6 with a 3.54 ERA in 31 starts, setting a career best for wins. He had 54 starts in the past two seasons, two shy of the amount needed for his 2015 salary to become guaranteed at $6 million. O'Day, 32, was 5-2 with four saves and a career-low 1.70 ERA in 68 games. If the options had been declined, O'Day would have received a $400,000 buyout and Chen $372,000. The moves were announced Thursday.
