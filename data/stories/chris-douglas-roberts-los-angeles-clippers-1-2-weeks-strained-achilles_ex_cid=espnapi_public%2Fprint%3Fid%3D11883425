LOS ANGELES -- Clippers forward Chris Douglas-Roberts has a strained right Achilles and could be sidelined one to two weeks, coach Doc Rivers said Saturday. Douglas-Roberts tweeted about the injury and the team's plan to sit him down until he recovers Friday. Douglas-Roberts has played in four games this season, averaging 2.0 points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.3 assists in 11.3 minutes. He has not played in the last two games and only played four minutes in his last game Nov. 11. "I would say this: He has had the problem and didn't really express it to the trainers from what I understand," Rivers said. "It probably has affected him, but he's new and he wanted to play and was going through that and didn't want to say anything and it got to a point where it really started affected him and he really had to say something."
