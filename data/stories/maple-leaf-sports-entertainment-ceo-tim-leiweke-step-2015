TORONTO -- Tim Leiweke, the CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, will step down next year. The company announced Thursday that Tim Leiweke will stay until June 30 or until a successor is appointed. The MLSE properties include the Toronto Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC. Leiweke, who joined the group in April 2013, says he plans to own and operate his own business. In his short tenure, Leiweke helped Toronto land the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, fired Toronto FC's president and general manager Kevin Payne and brought in former star player Brendan Shanahan as president of the Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs missed the playoffs last spring, but the Raptors returned to the postseason for the first time in six years. Toronto FC is in third place in the Eastern Conference standings.
