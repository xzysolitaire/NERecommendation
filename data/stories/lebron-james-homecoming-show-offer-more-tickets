AKRON, Ohio -- LeBron James' hometown says more tickets are being offered for the homecoming event set to be his first public appearance in the state since he announced his return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The first round of free tickets for the Aug. 8 show at InfoCision Stadium in Akron was released Monday, and fans claimed them within hours. The city says more tickets will be made available Wednesday evening in response to the overwhelming demand. Organizers aren't divulging how many tickets are being offered Wednesday or in total. The stadium holds more than 27,000 people. It is unclear how much space will be used for the event, which is described as a show rather than a rally or party. James is returning to Cleveland four years after he left to join the Miami Heat.
