Every year, one of the most interesting aspects of the NBA draft combine is the list detailing the official height and weight of each player. Here's a look at how each player in the draft measured up at the combine. The NBA spends more time scrutinizing things such as wingspan and standing reach than it does actual heights. How big a player is with his hands above his head (for bigs) and with his arms outstretched (for guards) means much more on the basketball floor than a static height. None of the top players in the draft -- Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker or Joel Embiid -- showed up for measurements, though all of them were measured last year at the Nike Hoop Summit, so we have a reasonably accurate measurement for each of them. Overall, the rest of the group did well. To read more of Chad Ford's analysis of the player measurements taken at the NBA draft combine, become an Insider today.
