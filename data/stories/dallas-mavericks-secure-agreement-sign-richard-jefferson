The Dallas Mavericks have secured an agreement to sign free-agent swingman Richard Jefferson, according to sources close to the process. Sources told ESPN.com that the Mavericks will soon add Jefferson to their roster on a one-year minimum deal. The Mavericks are known to be in the hunt for wing depth and perimeter shooting after losing Vince Carter, although they landed restricted free agent Chandler Parsons when Houston decided not to match Dallas' offer sheet, a source told ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman. Jefferson, a 13-year veteran, played for Utah last season, starting 78 games for the Jazz at age 33. Jefferson spent the first seven seasons of his career with the then-New Jersey Nets before stops in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Golden State and Utah. The Mavs jumped at the chance to add a veteran on a minimum deal who shot 41 percent from 3-point range with the Jazz last season.
