Jerome Miron/USA TODAY SportsWill Dirk Nowitzki deliver the goods for his fantasy owners again in 2014-15? At last, the long wait is just about over, as the NBA's regular season tips off Oct. 28 with three games on the schedule. For those of you who haven't had your fantasy draft -- and even the many of you who have -- here is a rundown of all the latest happenings around the league that you need to know. We also zero in on the big fantasy targets on all 30 teams -- factoring in average draft position as of Oct. 22, breakout potential and injury history -- to come up with our safest bets, biggest risks and best values for this season. Atlanta Hawks Safest bet: Paul Millsap Biggest risk: Al Horford Best value: Kyle Korver Consider this: Millsap's big season in 2013-14 came during a campaign when Horford missed 53 games due to injury. But a closer look at the stats via nbawowy.com shows that Millsap's production barely changed after his frontcourt mate was lost for the season. While Millsap's usage rate rose from 22 to 26.9, many other advanced stats remained remarkably consistent: Total rebound rate (12.4 with Horford to 13.2 without him), true shooting percentage (54 to 54.2 percent), points per possession (1.05 to 1.06), steal rate (2.5 to 2.6) and block rate (2.6 to 2.7). Expect more of the same from Millsap with or without Horford this season. Boston Celtics Safest bet: Jeff Green Biggest risk: Rajon Rondo Best value: Jared Sullinger Consider this: To see best bets, biggest risks and best value players for every NBA team ahead of the fantasy basketball season, you must be an ESPN Insider.
