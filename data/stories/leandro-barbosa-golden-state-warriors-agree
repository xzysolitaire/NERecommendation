BILBAO, Spain -- â€ŽBrazil guard Leandro Barbosa has reached an agreement to sign with the Golden State Warriors for the upcoming season, ESPN.com has learned. After Barbosa received initial interest from the Miami Heat, Golden State has secured a commitment from the 31-year-old on a one-year deal at the veteran minimum, according to NBA front-office sources. Barbosa played 20 games last season with the Phoenix Suns, with whom he broke into the NBA in 2003-04. He's also had stints in Indiana, Toronto and Boston. The Warriors have been looking for guard depth and happily struck a deal with Barbosa before this weekend's start of the FIBA World Cup in Spain. The Heat, meanwhile, on Wednesday signed fellow veteran Shannon Brown to add to their backcourt. Barbosa joins fellow NBA veterans Nene, Tiago Splitter and Anderson Varejao in leading a Brazilian squad that sees itself as a real contender for the championship along with the two consensus favorites: Team USA and host Spain. Asked recently about his NBA future, Barbosa told ESPN.com: "Man, I'm just really focused on this World Cup."
