LOS ANGELES -- Chicago Bulls forward Ronnie Brewer has pleaded not guilty to a drunken driving charge in Beverly Hills. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office says Brewer entered pleas through an attorney Wednesday to misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence and driving with a blood-alcohol level of at least 0.08. Prosecutors allege his blood-alcohol level was 0.15 percent or more -- nearly twice the legal limit. Brewer was stopped in February near Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. He was charged last month.
