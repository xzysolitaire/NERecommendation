The Cleveland Cavaliers claimed veteran guard A.J. Price off waivers from the Indiana Pacers on Sunday. To make room for Price on the roster, the Cavs waived rookie guard Will Cherry. It is a reversal of a roster move the Cavs made the first week of the regular season when they released Price so they could sign Cherry. Days later the Cavs lost backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova for 4-6 weeks with a sprained knee. Price played well in 10 games with the Pacers, averaging 10.5 points and 2.7 assists while shooting 44 percent. The Pacers waived Price after point guard C.J. Watson returned from injury last week. Cherry averaged 1.9 points and one assist in eight games of limited playing time with the Cavs.
