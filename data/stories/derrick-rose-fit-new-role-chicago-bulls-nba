No NBA player enters the 2014-15 season with a wider range of possible outcomes than Derrick Rose. Have Rose's two FIBA performances in Spain shed any light on what may happen? Not really -- and how could they? Nevertheless, Rose's complementary role on the loaded Team USA squad could be a forerunner version of the Rose we're going to get in what the Bulls hope will be his first healthy season in four years. As you may already know, Rose has played in just 50 games, including the playoffs, over the last three NBA seasons. That's just 50 of 237 games (21 percent) of Chicago's regular and postseason games during that span. Both numbers are significant, because they mean not only has Rose's career trajectory been thrown askew, but his teammates have gotten used to playing without him.
