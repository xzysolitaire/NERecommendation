Getty ImagesMarcus Smart, Rodney Hood and Nik Stauskas would be at the top of a non-freshman draft board. On Tuesday, we took a look at NBA commissioner Adam Silver's push to raise the NBA age restriction from 19 to 20. If Silver can convince the players' association that it's a good idea, the new rule could go into effect as early as the 2015 NBA draft. But that got us thinking ... what would happen if NCAA freshmen and international players under the age of 20 weren't allowed to declare for the draft this year? Eight of the top 10 players on our Big Board -- Joel Embiid, Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Noah Vonleh and Tyler Ennis -- would be ineligible for the draft. Losing all eight of those players would dramatically alter and weaken this year's draft, essentially leading it void of franchise players. So what would this year's draft lottery look like without the freshmen? Last week we unveiled the third iteration of our 2014 NBA mock draft. Here's a revised mock draft lottery that shows just how weak it would be minus freshmen. Smart 1. Milwaukee Bucks Marcus Smart, PG, Oklahoma State There's a pretty big drop off from the likes of Embiid, Wiggins and Parker to Smart. However, the Bucks can still be very happy with this pick. Of all the players left on the list after the freshmen are taken out, Smart is the one player who has the ability to be an NBA star someday. Plus, he'd be a solid fit in a backcourt with Brandon Knight. To see the rest of Chad Ford's non-freshmen lottery mock draft, sign up to become an ESPN Insider.
