Aldon Smith and the San Francisco 49ers should learn fairly soon what if any disciplinary action the star pass-rusher will receive from the NFL. According to an NFL source, Smith is expected to fly to New York sometime in the near future. It could be as soon as next week, although an exact date has not been set. The meeting will be held to discuss his off-field issues with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Potential discipline could be made by Goodell shortly after the meeting. Goodell has routinely met with troubled players at the league offices before making disciplinary decisions. Smith was sentenced to 11 days of work release last week in a Santa Clara County, California, court after his Sept. 2013 arrest for drunk driving. It was his second such arrest since entering the NFL in 2011. Also, Smith had three felony gun charges knocked down to misdemeanors last week. Smith voluntary missed five games last season when he entered a substance-abuse treatment center. In October, in London, Goodell told reporters Smith's aggressive approach to his problem could be considered when potential discipline was addressed. In April, Smith was arrested on an alleged fake bomb threat. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office declined to press charges. Smith is set to meet with officials in Los Angles to discuss and close the matter July 30. Smith and the 49ers reported to training camp Wednesday. The first training camp practice is Thursday. Smith, the No. 7 overall draft pick in 2011, has 42 sacks in 43 regular season games.
