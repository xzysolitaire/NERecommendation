TORONTO -- Blue Jays left-hander Daniel Norris underwent arthroscopic surgery Tuesday to remove bone spurs and loose bodies in his pitching elbow. The procedure was performed by Mets medical director Dr. David Altchek, the team said. The 21-year-old will need at least six weeks of recovery time and is expected to be ready for spring training. Norris had a 5.40 ERA in one start and four relief appearances during a late-season call-up, when he allowed four runs in 6 2-3 innings. He was 12-2 with a 2.53 ERA this year at three minor-league levels, including 3-1 with a 3.18 ERA in five games at Triple-A Buffalo.
