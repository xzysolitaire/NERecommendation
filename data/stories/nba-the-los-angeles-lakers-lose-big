The Los Angeles Lakers' title hopes snapped on April 12, 2013, when Kobe Bryant's Achilles tendon ruptured. Eighteen months later, their future suffered the same fate when lottery pick Julius Randle's right tibia broke 13 minutes into his professional debut. A day later, the Lakers find themselves on unfamiliar ground. Their title aspirations are gone and, for at least this season, so is their future. What happens next will likely determine the Lakers' success for the rest of the decade.
