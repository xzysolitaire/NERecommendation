Phil Jackson met with NBA lifer Mike Dunleavy on Friday morning to discuss the New York Knicks' vacant head-coaching job, sources confirmed to ESPN.com. While one source close to the situation said Dunleavy is not at the top of Jackson's list, the source acknowledged he is indeed a candidate. Dunleavy, who has coached four NBA teams over 17 years, is also a candidate for the Los Angeles Lakers' open job, according to a source. Dunleavy has had a friendly relationship with Jackson since their playing days in the 1970s. With both living in Los Angeles, they have periodically met for lunch over the years. Dunleavy, who last coached the Clippers from 2003 to '10, has often used Jackson's beloved triangle offense, and Frank Hamblen, a longtime Jackson assistant, served on Dunleavy's staff in Milwaukee in the early 1990s.
