DALLAS -- Mavericks forward Shawn Marion declared himself ready to return after missing the last four games with a bruised right shoulder and ribs. Marion went through a full practice Tuesday for the first time since being injured in a Jan. 7 win over the Los Angeles Lakers and will play in Wednesday night's road game against the Los Angeles Clippers despite still feeling some stiffness and soreness. "I think it's something I can tolerate now," Marion said. "I'm good to go. I plan on playing. I'm ready to go, man. I can't sit out too much longer. It's tolerable, so I'm going to give it a go and help my team on this road trip." Marion, a 15-year veteran who is the Mavs' best defender, averages 11.3 points and a team-high 7.2 rebounds per game. He was injured when he crashed to the court after tripping over the Lakers' Pau Gasol and teammate Dirk Nowitzki. In other news, Mavs guard Devin Harris went through a full practice Tuesday for the first time since suffering a setback last month in his rehabilitation from summer toe surgery. Harris could potentially make his season debut as soon as next week. "I'm encouraged," coach Rick Carlisle said of Harris. "He's moving well. It's been a process where we've had to do a pushback, kind of re-start it, but he's done everything that he's supposed to and he's getting where he needs to get. We're getting closer and closer."
