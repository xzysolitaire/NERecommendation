BALTIMORE -- Ed Reed said he's not planning to retire this year, although the perennial Pro Bowl safety may not sign with another team until the season begins. "Yes, definitely preparing to play," Reed said Sunday at cornerback Lardarius Webb's charity softball game at M&T Bank Stadium. "I'm not in any rush at all. I learned a lot about the process last year and I know my worth. I'm taking my time getting myself all the way back to where I want to be. I'll come back down to it somewhere in season. I'll probably wind up somewhere, or not." Reed, 35, spent nine Pro Bowl seasons with the Ravens and won a Super Bowl in his final game with them in February 2013. He signed a three-year, $15 million contract with the Houston Texans as a free agent last year but struggled mightily and was eventually benched. He was released after making no interceptions in seven games. Reed finished last season by signing with the New York Jets and reuniting with coach Rex Ryan, the former Ravens defensive coordinator. During his time with the Ravens, Reed battled through a nerve impingement in his neck and a hip injury. He routinely didn't participate in offseason workouts. Not surprisingly, Reed wants to wait before signing with another team. "I'm not going to anybody's training camp," Reed said. "I sat and watched the league from a different perspective and learned a lot. I saw they had teams that needed safeties in the latter part of the year. Right now, I'm just about taking care of me. I'm getting myself back to where there's not questions on my part. I know you guys (the media) may question, but I'm not really worried about that. It's about how I feel." If there is no interest from other teams, Reed said he won't make any formal retirement announcement. "I know that I can still play," Reed said. "It's just a matter of the right fit. If not, you guys probably never see me again."
