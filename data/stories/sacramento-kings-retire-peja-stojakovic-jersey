SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento Kings are planning to retire Peja Stojakovic's No. 16 jersey. The Kings announced Tuesday that Stojakovic's jersey will be retired when they host Oklahoma City on Dec. 16. He joins Vlade Divac (21), Chris Webber (4) and Mitch Richmond (2) as the only players to have their jerseys retired by the Kings since the franchise moved from Kansas City in 1985. Sacramento drafted the Serbian-born Stojakovic 14th overall in 1996. In eight seasons with the Kings, he averaged 18.3 points and five rebounds and made three All-Star teams. Stojakovic is the franchise leader for 3-pointers made (1,070) and attempted (2,687) and free throw percentage (.893). He also played for Indiana, New Orleans, Toronto and Dallas during his 13-year NBA career.
