NEW YORK -- The NBA has hired former Wasserman Media Group executive Malcolm Turner to be the president of its Development League. The NBA announced the hiring on Thursday. Turner interned for the NBA while he was in school at Harvard and most recently worked as managing director of Wasserman's golf division. With the D-League, Turner will report to deputy commissioner Mark Tatum and oversee the 18-team league's business and basketball operations. Turner got to know NBA Commissioner Adam Silver while working on the launch of the WNBA during his internship in 1996. Turner says he is looking forward to working in basketball again and recognizes the growing significance of the NBA's minor league. Seventeen teams currently have direct, one-to-one affiliations with a D-League team and more teams are pushing to do the same.
