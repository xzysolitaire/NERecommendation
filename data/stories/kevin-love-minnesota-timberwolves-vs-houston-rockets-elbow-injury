MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota forward Kevin Love missed the Timberwolves' game against Houston on Friday night because of a hyperextended right elbow. Love was injured in a loss to Chicago on Wednesday night, but was able to play through the pain and finish the game. He said after that game that he hoped to play against the Rockets, and coach Rick Adelman said about 90 minutes before tipoff that he was hopeful Love would be able to go. But the Timberwolves announced shortly before tip that he was unavailable. Love is averaging 25.8 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Wolves continue to be without center Nikola Pekovic, forward Shabazz Muhammad, guard Kevin Martin and forward Chase Budinger because of injuries. J.J. Barea returned after sitting out Wednesday with a back injury.
