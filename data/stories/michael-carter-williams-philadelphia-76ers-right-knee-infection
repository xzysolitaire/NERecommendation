Philadelphia 76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams will miss a fourth consecutive game as he recovers from a right knee infection, coach Brett Brown said after the team's shootaround on Wednesday. Brown said the rookie standout, who is averaging 17.7 points and 7.3 assists per game, will not play Wednesday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves and that there is no date for his return. Carter-Williams will continue to travel with the team but won't play until the infection is gone and the knee has healed.
