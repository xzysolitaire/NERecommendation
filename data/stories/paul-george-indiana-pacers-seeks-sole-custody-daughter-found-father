Indiana Pacers forward Paul George, who was hit with a paternity suit by a former stripper during the Eastern Conference finals, is now seeking sole custody of the 2-month-old girl if he's found to be the father, according to multiple media reports. According to court documents, George filed for custody because he "has the means and resources to be a fully involved parent and to capably care for the child" and that the mother, Daniela Rajic, "is not capable of the care" as she is "currently unemployed and has refused to seek or gain employment and is dependent upon others for the care of the child." George's petition would also allow for limited parental time sharing for Rajic. The 24-year-old Rajic, who gave birth to daughter Olivia on May 1, has also filed for sole custody, saying George's travel schedule would be detrimental to raising a child. Her lawyer, Raoul Felder, told the New York Post that George's defense is "grossly insulting to women" as Rajic is out of work "because she has a 2-month-old child." George, who already had earlier met the baby and voluntarily paid the medical bills, also is questioning the validity of the pre-birth paternity test and is seeking another. The Post reported in May that George, 24, had a relationship with Rajic for a few months last summer after meeting in Miami, where she reportedly worked at Tootsie's Cabaret. Rajic has since moved to New York to be with her family, and she is currently a full-time mom. George is seeking to have the custody trial, which has been delayed, moved to Florida.
