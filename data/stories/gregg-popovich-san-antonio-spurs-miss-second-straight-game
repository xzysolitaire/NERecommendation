SAN ANTONIO -- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will miss his second straight game after recently undergoing an undisclosed minor medical procedure. San Antonio assistant Ettore Messina will serve as head coach Friday night against the Sacramento Kings in Popovich's absence, as he did in a 106-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. Popovich's status is unknown for the team's upcoming four-game road trip, which begins Sunday in Boston, but he did visit with the team Friday morning. "He was here for shootaround for a second, for a little bit," Spurs wing Danny Green said. "We spoke to him. He said what he had to say, some good, some bad. He told us we can't wait 'til the last five minutes to play defense." The Spurs rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the Pacers as Messina became the first European-born coach to helm an NBA team in the regular season. The Kings will be without veteran forward DeMarcus Cousins, who woke up "feeling sick," according to Sacramento coach Michael Malone.
