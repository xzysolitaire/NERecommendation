NEW YORK -- New York Knicks forward Carmelo AnthonyÂ scored 31 points in his return to the lineup Sunday night in an 86-79 loss to the Miami Heat. Anthony had missed the Knicks' past two games due to painful back spasms. The spasms first surfaced late in the first half of the Knicks' loss to the Houston Rockets on Monday night. Anthony said the pain was so severe that he couldn't speak to his teammates late Monday night. Anthony was listed as doubtful for Sunday's game earlier in the day, but he participated in the Knicks' morning shootaround, clearing the way for him to play Sunday night against Miami. He was still feeling some pain in his back after the game. "Just some tightness. I don't know if it's the spasm or not, but some tightness. It's probably going to take a while to get it loosened up," Anthony said. Anthony started at small forward and played a team-high 41 minutes. He also grabbed eight rebounds and handed out two assists. Knicks coach Derek Fisher said he didn't anticipate playing Anthony for more than 40 minutes but felt that he could handle it because of the slow pace of the game. "There were enough fouls, enough timeouts to stretch his minutes out," he said. The Knicks (4-14) lost two straight without Anthony and have now dropped 11 of their past 13 games.
