TORONTO -- Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose sat out Friday night's 96-80 victory against the Toronto Raptors with a sore right hamstring. "Just being smart about the situation," Rose said before the game. "There's nothing like rest and resting another day then having to play [Saturday]. Not overlooking this game, though, we still got to go out here and play and win this game. But [I'm] being smart about my body, listening to my body, and [the hamstring] was just tight. The tightness didn't loosen up." Rose is still hoping to play against the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night. "I hope so," he said. "But if it's still tight there's no need to." Rose injured the hamstring late in Monday night's win against the Cleveland Cavaliers and has missed the last two days of practice while rehabbing the injury. He also skipped Friday morning's shootaround. Coach Tom Thibodeau said he wants to continue to be cautious with his 25-year-old point guard. "He's improved, but he's still not quite there," Thibodeau said. "So we'll see where he is [Saturday]. Each day he's gotten better, so we just want to make sure. We'll see where it is -- and we don't want to skip over things. I hate to speculate [if he'll play Saturday] because we don't know."
