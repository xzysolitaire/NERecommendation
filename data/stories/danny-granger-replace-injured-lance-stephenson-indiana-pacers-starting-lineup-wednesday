Danny Granger got his first start since May 2012 as the Indiana Pacers put the long-injured forward into their starting lineup to face the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. Granger replaced Lance Stephenson, who is sidelined with a right knee contusion. Stephenson, who leads the NBA in triple-doubles with three, averages 13.4 points, 5.2 assists and 6.6 rebounds per game for the Pacers (28-6). Granger, who has played in just 14 games since the start of the 2012-13 season, has played in only nine games this season entering Wednesday due to a calf injury. The former All-Star led the team in scoring for five straight seasons before a bout of patella tendinitis that ultimately led to surgery forced him to miss all but five games last season.
