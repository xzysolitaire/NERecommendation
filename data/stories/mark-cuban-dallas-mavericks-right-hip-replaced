Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban posted a video to Instagram of him taking his first steps a day after having his right hip replaced. This is the second total hip replacement that Cuban, 55, has undergone. He had his left hip replaced in 2007, months before participating in the ABC show "Dancing With the Stars." Cuban suffers from osteoarthritis, a painful disease that affects millions. Osteoarthritis causes protective cartilage on the ends of bones to wear down over time. Cuban exercises on a regular basis, routinely conducting interviews from the StairMaster in the Mavericks' weight room before home games.
