Brooklyn Nets point guard Deron Williams will not travel to London for the team's upcoming game Thursday against the Atlanta Hawks. The team will practice in London on Tuesday and Wednesday in advance of the game. Williams (sprained left ankle) will be missing his 16th game of the season. There is no timetable for his return. Williams received a cortisone shot and platelet-rich plasma injection in both of his ankles following an MRI Monday. Alan Anderson has been starting in Williams' absence alongside Shaun Livingston in the backcourt. The Nets (15-22) have won five of their last six games.
