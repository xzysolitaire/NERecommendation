TORONTO -- During a meeting with the media following a sports conference in Toronto, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman shot down speculation that the league's owners will vote on expansion at the December board of governors meeting. The topic of expansion has heated up, with Las Vegas and Seattle the front-runners to land a franchise, but Bettman continues to stress publicly that nothing is imminent. "I know it's been widely reported that there's a deal and there's going to be a vote. There won't be any votes," Bettman said of his plans for the upcoming board of governors meeting in Boca Raton, Florida. "All I'll do is continue to report on the levels of interest being expressed." Bettman confirmed that there is plenty of interest but still no timeline for NHL expansion. "Even if we decided tomorrow, it wouldn't happen for two or three more years," Bettman said. "We're focusing on things like the World Cup, international [play]. There's no effort crying out for immediate expansion, but we are getting expressions of interest."
