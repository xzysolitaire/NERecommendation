Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard will miss his third straight game, sitting out Monday against the New York Knicks due to his strained right knee. Point guard Patrick Beverley, who has a strained left hamstring, also will miss the game, the team announced. The Rockets announced last week that there was no timetable for Howard's return. He had initially been listed as questionable for Monday's game. Rookie Tarik Black started in Howard's place in Houston's last game, a 95-92 victory Saturday over the Dallas Mavericks. He scored 3 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in the win. Howard underwent platelet-rich plasma therapy last Thursday to treat his injury. PRP therapy places a patient's blood in a centrifuge and spins it to separate the platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the injured tissue. It is generally used for long-term treatment, although Howard expressed hope that he wouldn't be sidelined for an extended period.
