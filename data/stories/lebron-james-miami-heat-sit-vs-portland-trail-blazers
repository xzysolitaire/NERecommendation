Miami Heat forward LeBron JamesÂ missed Saturday's 108-107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers after straining his right groin and aggravating a left ankle sprain in Friday's loss to the Sacramento Kings. It was his first game missed this season. Miami will have Ray Allen (knee) and Dwyane Wade (knee), who sat out Friday's game. Greg Oden is inactive and Chris Andersen (back) has been ruled out. James tweaked his ankle late in the second quarter when he landed on a referee's foot after missing a contested layup. He scored 19 of his game-high 33 points in the first half but struggled with his offense in the third quarter as the Kings gradually erased a 17-point deficit in the 108-103 overtime win. James was visibly limping in the second half but said he never considered asking to come out of the game. He made three 3-pointers in overtime to keep Miami close until the final seconds. In the process, James passed Larry Bird and Gary Payton to move into 29th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. After playing 44 minutes, James said he wasn't certain when he strained his groin. "If it's not one injury, it's the next one," said James, who finished with eight rebounds and eight assists along with the 33 points. "So hopefully I can get through this one." It is the same problematic ankle James sprained in a Dec. 16 win against Utah. But James insisted after Friday's game that the ankle was not as much of an issue as the strained groin.
