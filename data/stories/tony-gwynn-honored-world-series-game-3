SAN FRANCISCO -- Late Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn was honored before Game 3 of the World Series. The San Diego Padres star died June 16 of oral cancer, a disease he attributed to years of chewing tobacco. He was 54. His family stood on the infield at AT&T Park with MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred as a tribute was played on the center-field video board that included Gwynn highlights and interviews.
