MIAMI -- Roy Hibbert said coach Frank Vogel's game plan was a reason he went scoreless in the Indiana Pacers' Game 4 loss to the Heat on Monday. Hibbert took just four shots, missing them all, and was in foul trouble in the Heat's 102-90 victory. It was the fourth time in the playoffs and the sixth time in his past 21 games Hibbert did not score a point. He did have five rebounds and blocked one shot. "The game plan really wasn't to utilize me as much; I'm just trying to be effective as I can," Hibbert said. "Would I like a little bit more touches early on? Yeah. But that's how the cookie crumbles sometimes." Vogel appeared to like the matchup with David West on surprise starter Rashard Lewis better. West took six shots in the first quarter, and Hibbert got just one. Afterward, the Pacers played from behind and Hibbert was limited with fouls. Hibbert scored 19 points in Game 1 of the series and 10 points in the first quarter of Game 3. But his shots have not been consistent. "I can only control what I can control," Hibbert said. "I can't control plays called for me." After averaging 22 points and 10 rebounds in the seven games of conference finals against the Heat last season, Hibbert is averaging just 11.8 points and 7.3 rebounds so far in this series. Last year he averaged about 15 shots a game against the Heat. The most he's taken in a game in this series is 13, and he's averaging about nine. "I just need to be a good teammate if I don't get looks," Hibbert said. Vogel said Hibbert was restricted in the offense because he got three fouls in the first half. When the Pacers tried to come back in the fourth quarter and went on a 15-3 run, it was with West and Luis Scola on the floor playing the big man positions. "He got some touch fouls that put him on the bench," Vogel said. "And he didn't get in a rhythm."
