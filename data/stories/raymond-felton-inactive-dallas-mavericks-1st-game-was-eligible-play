DALLAS -- The wait continues for guard Raymond Felton to make his debut for the Dallas Mavericks. Felton was inactive in Monday night's 111-100 loss to the Indiana Pacers, the first game he was eligible to play this season after recovering from a high right ankle sprain and serving a four-game suspension stemming from gun charges in New York last season. Felton, who was acquired along with center Tyson Chandler in a six-player trade with the New York Knicks over the summer, is the odd man out for now in the Mavs' crowded backcourt. Jameer Nelson and Monta Ellis have started every game for the 10-5 Mavs. Devin Harris and J.J. Barea have served as dual spark plugs off the bench. "We've got a good situation," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said before Monday's game. "There are a lot of teams right now that would die to have one or two of our point guards. We've got one or two extra, which is a great position to be in." Felton, who has averaged 13.1 points and 6.5 assists per game in nine NBA seasons, has been almost solely a starter throughout his career but is willing to adapt to a different role in Dallas. He isn't certain, however, how he might fit in the Mavs' rotation. "That's not my decision to make," Felton said. "I've worked hard through training camp and I've worked hard ever since I've been injured, so the biggest thing is whatever Coach and this staff needs me to do, that's what I'll do."
