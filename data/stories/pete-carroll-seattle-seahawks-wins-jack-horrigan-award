SEATTLE -- Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has won the Jack Horrigan Award for his accessibility and enthusiastic cooperation with the media. Carroll received the award from the Professional Football Writers of America on Thursday. The Horrigan Award is given to the league or club official for qualities and professional style in helping the pro football writers do their job. Carroll was recognized for his dealings with the media as Seattle made its run to its first Super Bowl title. He was praised for never being "reluctant to recognize the effort, the dedication, the pain and the hardships attendant to an athlete's life." He's the second Seahawk to win the award; then-coach Mike Holmgren received it in 2008.
