LAS VEGAS -- An attorney for former NFL running back Larry Johnson says the player's Las Vegas domestic violence case is now closed after a judge determined he successfully completed community service and counseling requirements. Attorney Gregory Knapp says he appeared in court on Johnson's behalf Wednesday and provided documents showing that the 34-year-old former Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins star completed his sentence. Knapp said the athlete volunteered for several nonprofits, including the American Heart Association. Johnson was arrested in October 2012 at the Bellagio after he was accused of beating and choking his 32-year-old ex-girlfriend. He was sentenced to probation, 48 hours of community service and six months of counseling after pleading no contest in July 2013 to misdemeanor battery and assault. Knapp says Johnson lives in Florida.
