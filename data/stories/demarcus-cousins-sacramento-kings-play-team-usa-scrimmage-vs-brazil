CHICAGO -- Sacramento Kings big man DeMarcus Cousins says his injured right knee is feeling better. "It's better than (Thursday), so that's a good sign," Cousins said after Friday's practice. "Just gradually trying to get through the pain. It's going to be a process. As the days go on it should get better." Cousins will not play in Team USA's scrimmage Saturday night against Brazil at the United Center. Cousins injured his right knee during a play at the end of Thursday's practice and underwent an MRI that showed no structural damage. He wore a sleeve on the knee on Friday and shot baskets on a different court while the rest of his teammates continued preparing for Saturday's game. Given the gruesome injury that Indiana Pacers star Paul George sustained in Team USA's scrimmage two weeks ago, Cousins admitted that a lot of fear went through his mind when he first went down. "It was a scary thing of course," Cousins said. "Speaking from some of the things that happened early on. It's basketball so things happen but luckily enough it wasn't anything too severe. I'll be back in a few days." Team USA center Anthony Davis did not go through much of Friday's practice because of a sore neck, but he is expected to play Saturday. "We expect (Davis) to play," coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "It's been a different route right now with a couple guys dropping out and injuries. DeMarcus won't play (Saturday). We expect Anthony to play (Saturday)."
