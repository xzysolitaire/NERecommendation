GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The Green Bay Packers and veteran receiver Jordy Nelson no doubt took notice of the contract extension Atlanta Falcons receiver Roddy White signed Thursday. Like Nelson, White was entering the final year of his contract and was seeking a long-term extension. Although the specific breakdown of the contract was not yet available, ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported that White's contract extension is worth up to $30 million over four seasons and included $18 million in guaranteed money. Nelson is seeking all of that -- and more. A source familiar with the negotiations said Nelson wants a deal worth at least $10 million per season. That would be a major increase from his current contract, which averages $4.2 million per season and ranks 34th among all NFL receivers. White was due to make $5 million this season. Nelson's 2014 pay is scheduled to be $3.5 million as part of the three-year, $12.6 million contract extension he signed Sept. 29, 2011. That contract turned out to be a bargain for the Packers, but Nelson ended up leaving money on the table. "When I signed it, I don't think I did," Nelson said earlier this offseason. "I think everyone, when I signed, thought it was a good deal. No one would have known I'd have 1,200 yards and 15 touchdowns [in 2011]. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20 but, again, I'm not worried about that at all. I've been comfortable with my decision." Still, there are differences between White and Nelson that could factor into the ongoing negotiations. For six straight seasons (from 2007-12), White eclipsed the 1,000-yard receiving mark. That streak ended last season in part because he missed three games because of injuries. Nelson does not have that kind of prolonged success, but over the last three seasons, he has comparable numbers. Since 2011, Nelson has 202 catches for 3,322 yards and 30 touchdowns. Over that same period, White has 255 catches for 3,358 yards and 18 touchdowns. However, they are at different points in their careers. Nelson just turned 29 less than two months ago, while White will turn 33 in November. Complicating matters for the Packers is the fact that their other top receiver, Randall Cobb, also is entering the final year of his contract. Indications are the Packers would like re-sign both. The Packers have $13,669,119 in salary-cap space, according to the latest figures from ESPN Stats & Information.
