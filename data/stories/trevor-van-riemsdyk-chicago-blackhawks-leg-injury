CHICAGO -- Trevor van Riemsdyk was ruled out of the rest of the Blackhawks' 6-2 win Sunday over the Dallas Stars after being struck in the left leg with a puck during the first period, an injury coach Joel Quenneville said would sideline the defenseman "for awhile." "He's hurt pretty bad," said Quenneville, who couldn't give a more specific timetable. "We'll know more tomorrow." Van Riemsdyk fell to the ice after being hit by a shot from Stars defenseman Trevor Daley at 6:18 of the first period. Van Riemsdyk appeared to struggle to put weight on his left foot, skated off the ice under his own power and shortly after went to the team's dressing. The Blackhawks announced van Riemsdyk would not return to the game after the beginning of the second period. Van Riemsdyk, who is the younger brother of Toronto Maple Leafs forward James van Riemsdyk, has played in all 18 of the Blackhawks' games this season as a rookie. He has one assist, has a zero rating and has averaged 14:11 of ice time.
