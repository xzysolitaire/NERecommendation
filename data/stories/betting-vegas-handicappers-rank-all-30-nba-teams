The Cleveland Cavaliers became the NBA title favorite in July when LeBron James decided to sign there, and they start the 2014-15 season as the top team in the NBA Vegas Rankings. But it's not a landslide. Our panel of handicappers -- Erin Rynning of sportsmemo.com, Geoff Kulesa of wunderdog.com and yours truly, Dave Tuley -- takes our individual power ratings and averages them to come up with our group's power ratings, which can then be used to weigh the relative strength of two teams and compare it to the point spread for a given game. One of us has the Cavaliers as 3.5 points higher than the No. 2 team, the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, and another has the Spurs tied for the best rating with the Los Angeles Clippers. When it all shook out, we have the Cavs rated one point ahead of the Spurs, with the Clippers another 1.5 points back. So there's less than a 3-pointer separating our top three teams. Then there's NBA Insider Kevin Pelton, whose SCHOENE projection system offers yet another look at how the season might end up. He's bullish on the Cavaliers, posting a 10-win difference from Vegas (see below). Here is the ranking of all 30 NBA teams from Vegas' perspective, along with which teams are overrated and underrated in their season win totals.
