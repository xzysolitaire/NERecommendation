Paul George's home was burglarized Monday night during the Indiana Pacers' Game 5 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in Indianapolis. A platinum NBA All-Star ring -- valued at $15,000 -- was among items stolen. George's parents discovered the theft and alerted authorities at midnight, according to a police report. The ring stolen was a 2014 platinum All-Star piece that includes multiple diamonds.Â A watch valued at $700, a pair of sneakers valued at $170, and a $20 bill also were reportedly taken. The police report estimates the total value of items taken at nearly $16,000. The theft occurred between 7:15 p.m. and 11:45 p.m. ET, according to the police report. There were no signs of forced entry and the home alarm system was not set. The All-Star small forward's parents told police that they did not lock the home when they left because they didn't have a key to get back inside. The Pacers lost 107-97 to the Hawks at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Game 5, putting the East top seed's season on the brink. George led the Pacers with 26 points and 12 rebounds.
