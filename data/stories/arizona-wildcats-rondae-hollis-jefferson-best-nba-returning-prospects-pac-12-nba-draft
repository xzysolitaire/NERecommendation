Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, G/F, Soph., Arizona Wildcats Ford's Big Board ranking: 17 Pelton's Draft Board ranking: 29 Ford: There's obviously a couple of elite freshman coming to the Pac-12 this season, led by Stanley Johnson of Arizona and Kevon Looney of UCLA. But of the returning players, Hollis-Jefferson is the highest-ranked player on my board. I thought he looked great for Arizona toward the end of his freshman season. He's long, athletic, has good strength, is a terrific defender with a high motor and has a real knack for getting to and finishing at the basket. He's a great intangibles guy, too.
