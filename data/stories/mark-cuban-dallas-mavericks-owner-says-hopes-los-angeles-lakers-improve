In a local radio interview Tuesday, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban didn't hold back when discussing the struggling Los Angeles Lakers, saying, "Personally, I just hope they suck forever." Cuban made his remarks about the Lakers, who at 2-9 are off to their worst start in franchise history, while he was on "The Fred Roggin Show" on The Beast 980, a radio station in Los Angeles. Roggin brought up the topic of how teams are constructed in the current NBA era, specifically the Lakers. "As far as the Lakers," Cuban said, "I think there are going to be a lot of teams that are going to be focusing and saying, 'Look, I've got a ton of cap room, free agents A, B and C, why don't you guys come together and come play for me?' And L.A. has always been considered a destination, so maybe they feel there's a valid strategy. You know me, Fred. Personally, I just hope they suck forever." It's not the first time Cuban has made remarks of that nature about the Lakers. Before the Lakers' much-anticipated 2012-13 season opener, when they had Dwight Howard, Cuban was asked for his thoughts on the new-look Lakers. "I don't know, I don't care, I just hope they suck," he said then. "You know, like any other team."
