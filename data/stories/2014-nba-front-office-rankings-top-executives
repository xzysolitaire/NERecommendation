Welcome to #NBAfrontofficerank, our first #NBArank for management. We're continuing our rankings with a look at the league's lead basketball decision-makers -- team presidents, general managers and, in some cases, owners. We revealed our owner rankings on Wednesday and will unveil our final category -- coaches -- on Friday. (Our ranking of all 30 teams' overall management was revealed Tuesday, and can be seen here.) We asked our ESPN Forecast panel to rate every owner, basketball decision-maker and coach from 0 to 10, and we asked the panel to tell us how important each role is. In particular, we asked the voters to rate each team's front-office management on its guidance and leadership in terms of how it affects overall on-court success, both in the short and long term. From there, we simply calculated the ratings to determine the best and worst front offices in the NBA. Here's what we found. Front-Office Rankings: Owners | Top executives | CoachesÂ | Overall
