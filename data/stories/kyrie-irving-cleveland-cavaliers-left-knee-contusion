An MRI exam Wednesday showed that Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving has a left knee contusion and is questionable for Thursday night's game against the Orlando Magic, the team announced. Irving tweeted about the injury Wednesday. Irving fell awkwardly and had to be helped off the floor in the third quarter against the Indiana Pacers. He was examined by a team doctor and returned to play the final minutes as the Cavs lost their sixth straight, 91-76. Following the game, Irving said he felt a "pop" in his knee and was concerned his injury was serious. "I thought the worst happened," Irving said. "I felt something pop in my knee. When I came back in, my left knee is pretty weak right now. I was falling all over the place. I didn't have my legs under me. It was a painful experience." The Cavs (10-21) have lost six in a row. Irving is the team's leading scorer, averaging 22.2 points a game along with 6.1 assists. The former No. 1 overall pick has been injury prone since coming into the NBA. He missed 38 games in his first two seasons with a variety of injuries, including a broken nose, a fractured jaw, a broken finger, a sprained knee and shoulder, and a concussion. Irving played in only 11 games as a freshman at Duke because of a foot injury, and he broke his hand after his rookie season when he slammed a padded wall during a summer league practice in Las Vegas. Irving set a goal to play in all 82 games this season, and hasn't missed one yet. The Cavs will likely take a cautious approach with Irving and may sit him for a game or two. Cleveland hosts the Magic on Thursday, plays at Brooklyn on Saturday and hosts the Pacers on Sunday.
