SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- The Carolina Panthers will be without first-round draft pick Kelvin Benjamin for at least a few days after an MRI taken on Monday determined the former Florida State wide receiver had a bone bruise in his left knee. Benjamin suffered the injury when he bumped his knee on the knee of another player during a late Sunday afternoon practice. He was taken to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Monday morning after experiencing pain and some swelling. Coach Ron Rivera said there was no structural damage. "There is no time frame. It's just a matter of time and getting him comfortable with it,'' Rivera said. "... It's really just a matter of days of it calming down, getting the swelling out and then working it back into shape. It could be a few days. Nothing is structurally wrong.'' Benjamin has been working as the No. 1 receiver and quarterback Cam Newton's first read at the start of most team drills and Rivera wants the rookie on the field as much as possible. "He's had a great camp," Rivera said. "He came in in tip-top shape and ready to roll. He's one of those guys who spent time with Cam [before camp] working out." Benjamin, 6-foot-5 and 240 pounds, was the 28th pick of the draft. He is the heir apparent to the No. 1 receiver's job that came open when Carolina cut all-time leading receiver Steve Smith during the offseason. Benjamin caught 54 passes for 1,011 yards and 15 touchdowns last year for Florida State, including the winning touchdown against Auburn in the national championship.
