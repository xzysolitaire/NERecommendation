Fernando Medina/NBAE/Getty ImagesKhris Middleton is projected to make 1.5 threes per game, and he is widely available. Two days into the NBA season, and if you're like me, you're already obsessing about your fantasy team's shortcomings. Am I right? This is a problem I created for myself when I invested most of my auction dollars on LeBron James and Anthony Davis, then couldn't help but use a good portion of what was left on Brook Lopez -- whom I got for $8 because everyone else avoided him -- and Nerlens Noel, the player I believe will be considered the biggest steal of the draft by season's end. While it was certainly nice to get some star power, and I can't complain about Davis' unbelievable opening game (26 points, 17 rebounds, 9 blocks, 3 steals, 2 assists), this approach left me woefully short-handed when it came to guards; particularly, guards who shoot it from deep. This was an easy trap to fall into if you weren't careful on draft day, because many guards around the league -- even ones regarded as top-100 fantasy players -- simply don't make many 3s. Luckily, there are a number of players who can help you if you are in the same tricky spot as I am.
