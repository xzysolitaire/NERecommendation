Two days into the NBA season, and if you're like me, you're already obsessing about your fantasy team's shortcomings. Am I right? This is a problem I created for myself when I invested most of my auction dollars on LeBron James and Anthony Davis, then couldn't help but use a good portion of what was left on Brook Lopez -- whom I got for $8 because everyone else avoided him -- and Nerlens Noel, the player I believe will be considered the biggest steal of the draft by season's end. While it was certainly nice to get some star power, and I can't complain about Davis' unbelievable opening game (26 points, 17 rebounds, 9 blocks, 3 steals, 2 assists), this approach left me woefully short-handed when it came to guards; particularly, guards who shoot it from deep. This was an easy trap to fall into if you weren't careful on draft day, because many guards around the league -- even ones regarded as top-100 fantasy players -- simply don't make many 3s. Luckily, there are a number of players who can help you if you are in the same tricky spot as I am.
