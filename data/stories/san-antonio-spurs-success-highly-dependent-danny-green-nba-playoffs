Soobum Im/USA TODAY SportsDanny Green's production from 3-point range has been a foolproof indicator of success for the Spurs. Last week, in the wake of the San Antonio Spurs' blowout win in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals, our J.A. Adande wrote that wing Danny Green "defines the Spurs." Green ended up defining the difference between the first two games of the series, both lopsided San Antonio victories, and the Oklahoma City Thunder's dominant Game 3 victory on Sunday back at home. After scoring 37 points and shooting 11-of-15 from 3-point range in the first two games of the series, Green was unable to repeat his hot shooting in Oklahoma City. After making his opening two shots, both 3s, Green missed nine of his next 10 attempts and scored just two points the rest of the game. The connection between Green's slump and his team's shouldn't be surprising. Green's performance serves as a bellwether for the Spurs' offense as a whole. And if San Antonio is to rebound in Tuesday night's Game 4, it will probably require finding a way to get Green going.
