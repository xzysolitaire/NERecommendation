Despite the Indiana Pacers' heartfelt movie tribute and presentation to Lance Stephenson, the two sides are currently at an impasse over a new deal, according to sources close to the situation. The Pacers offered a five-year, $44 million contract to Stephenson, but sources said the versatile shooting guard believes he's worth much more. Stephenson averaged 13.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists last season -- all career highs for the four-year player. "Lance and his representatives aren't sure they're going to be able to reach an agreement with the Pacers," a source said. "It's clear they want him back and he wanted to go back, but they may not be able to come to terms." Several clubs have reached out to Stephenson's agent, Alberto Ebanks, to register their interest, most notably the Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls, according to sources. Michael Jordan and the Charlotte Hornets also have interest in Stephenson. While money is a factor, Stephenson will not simply go to the highest bidder, sources said. He wants to go to a team that is either a contender or a competitive up-and-coming club. The Pacers pulled out all the stops Tuesday by hosting Stephenson and his family at a local theater and surprising him with a movie about his life. With lucrative contracts already committed to Paul George ($15.8 million), Roy Hibbert ($14.9 million) and David West ($12 million), the Pacers feel they are offering Stephenson as much as they can while remaining financially prudent.
