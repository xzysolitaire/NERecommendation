LAS VEGAS -- Police in Las Vegas say no crime was committed when former major league slugger Jose Canseco shot himself in the finger in what he and investigators say was an accident. The former Oakland Athletics outfielder tweeted a photo Wednesday of his heavily bandaged left hand and said he was recovering at home. Canseco's fiancee, Leila Knight, was also active on social media urging friends to pray for his finger. Police say Knight was in the house Tuesday afternoon when the gun discharged as Canseco was cleaning in it the kitchen. Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.
