The Washington Wizards are set to acquire veteran forward Kris Humphries as part of a sign-and-trade deal with the Boston Celtics, sources confirmed to ESPN.com. Humphries is expected to sign a three-year, $13 million contract. The Wizards and Celtics are finalizing the details of the sign-and-trade agreement. The deal was first reported by Bleacher Report. Humphries averaged 8.4 points and 5.9 rebounds over 19.9 minutes per game last season. Acquired as part of the blockbuster deal that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to Brooklyn, Humphries earned a team-high $12 million last season and emerged as a locker-room leader while nurturing the development of Boston's younger talent. Humphries took to Twitter to say he's ready to get started with his new team by calling out the address of Verizon Center -- the Wizards' home arena. The Celtics, stocked with young talent at power forward, were not expected to re-sign Humphries this summer. It seems likely that Boston will receive a trade exception as part of the sign-and-trade agreement with Washington. The Wizards appear to have the ability to absorb Humphries' contract by receiving a trade exception as part of the sign-and-trade deal that will send Trevor Ariza to the Houston Rockets.
