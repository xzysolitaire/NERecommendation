Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch is expected to skip the mandatory team minicamp next week because he wants a contract extension, sources confirmed Wednesday night. "It's very, very unlikely that Lynch will be there,'' said a source close to the situation. "He wants the Seahawks to renegotiate his current contract and provide him with more up-front money." Lynch could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening. Thursday is the final day of organized team activities for Seattle, voluntary workouts that Lynch has not attended over the last three weeks. Lynch, 28, is starting the third year of a four-year deal that is worth $30 million, including $6 million in signing bonus. His base salary this season is $5 million and counts $7 million against the salary cap. The final year of the deal in 2015 would cost $9 million against the cap and pay Lynch $5.5 million in base salary. If Lynch skips the three-day minicamp that begins Tuesday, it will cost him $70,000 in fines. The Seahawks acquired Lynch in a trade with Buffalo in 2010. He has rushed for over 1,000 yards each of the last three seasons, including 1,257 yards and 14 touchdowns in helping the Seahawks win the Super Bowl last season. He has the most touchdowns in the NFL since the start of the 2011 season with 39 -- 35 rushing and four receiving. Lynch also has the most 100-yard rushing games in the NFL since 2011 with 19.
