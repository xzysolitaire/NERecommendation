WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama says campus sexual assault is "an affront to our basic humanity." Obama spoke Friday as the White House unveiled a new campaign to change the way people think about campus sexual assault. A new public service announcement features Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other familiar faces telling viewers they have a responsibility to stop sexual assault. The campaign encourages people on campus to make sure friends are safe and to intervene before an assault happens. Jon Hamm of "Mad Men," Kerry Washington of "Scandal" and NBA All-Star Kevin Love are some of the familiar faces participating in the "It's On Us" campaign. Obama touted the campaign weeks before a midterm election in which Democrats are counting on a strong turnout by female voters.
