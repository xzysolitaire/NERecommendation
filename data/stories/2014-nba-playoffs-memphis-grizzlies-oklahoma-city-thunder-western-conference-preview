Mark D. Smith/USA TODAY SportsThe Grizzlies and Thunder have battled in three of the last four postseasons. Insider offers a breakdown of every playoff series using an expert combination of scouting from Amin Elhassan and advanced metrics from Bradford Doolittle to answer three crucial questions. Also included are predictions from the writers and the classic Log5 formula for determining matchup probabilities. The Oklahoma City Thunder had to be thrilled to not only lock down the second seed by escaping with a one-point win against Detroit on Wednesday, but also to discover their first-round opponent would be the Memphis Grizzlies, who moved up a spot on Wednesday by knocking off Dallas in overtime. It was just last season that the Grizzlies eliminated the top-seeded Thunder in the West semifinals, so OKC is licking its chops at this chance for retribution. This also marks the third time in four years these teams have met in the playoffs, so they know each other very well. Russell Westbrook wasn't around for the 2013 playoff disappointment, and Memphis will have to face a full-strength Oklahoma City squad this time around.
