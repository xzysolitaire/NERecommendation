PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Clippers officially added Sam Cassell, Lawrence Frank and Mike Woodson as assistant coaches, the team announced Monday. The trio joins current assistant coaches Armond Hill and Brendan O'Connor as well as assistant player skills coaches JP Clark and Dave Severns on Doc Rivers' bench. "We have an impressive and experienced group of coaches who are excited to get to work," Rivers said. "Mike and Lawrence have enjoyed tremendous success as head coaches and Sam is someone who I coached as a player and respected as an assistant with the Wizards. I am excited to continue to work with the entire staff as we prepare for the season." Cassell, 44, joins the Clippers from the Washington Wizards where he served as an assistant coach for the last five seasons. Cassell played for the Clippers for two seasons, leading them to Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals in 2006, which is still their deepest postseason run. He also won an NBA title as a player with the Boston Celtics with Rivers as his coach. Frank, 44, was a member of Rivers' coaching staff in Boston during the 2010-2011 season and was the head coach of the New Jersey Nets from 2003-2010 where he accumulated a 225-241 (.483) overall record and led them to the playoffs four times. Frank also served as head coach of the Detroit Pistons for two seasons (2011-2013), collecting a total record of 54-94 (.365). Woodson, 56, joins the Clippers with over 18 years of NBA coaching experience including eight seasons as a head coach. A former Clippers player, Woodson averaged 17.5 points and was the Clippers leading scorer during his two seasons (1986-87 and 1987-88) with the team. Woodson was the head coach of the New York Knicks from March 25, 2012 until the end of the 2013-14 season, compiling a 107-79 (.575) record including a 2012-13 Atlantic Division Championship, the team's first since 1993-94. He owns a 315-365 (.463) career won-loss mark in eight full seasons as an NBA head coach (six with the Atlanta Hawks and two with the Knicks). The Clippers also announced their 16-man 2014-15 training camp roster, which included free agents Jared Cunningham and Joe Ingle. Cunningham was the 24th overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft by Cleveland and has appeared in 21 career NBA games in two seasons. He holds career averages of 2.0 points in 5.0 minutes with three NBA teams (Dallas, Atlanta and Sacramento). Ingles is considered one of the best Australian players of all-time and has played professionally since the age of 18 in Australia, Spain and Israel. Ingles has played for the Australian National Team since the 2008 Olympics. He was impressive this summer in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup where he averaged 11.4 points and 3.4 assists in six games. In the 2012 Olympics, Ingles averaged 15.0 points and 5.0 rebounds in six games.
