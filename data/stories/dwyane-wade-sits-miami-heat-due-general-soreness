MIAMI -- Hours after being named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, Heat guard Dwyane Wade will sit out Monday's game against the Atlanta Hawks due to general soreness, head coach Erik Spoelstra announced. Wade is considered day to day and Heat guard Ray Allen will start in his place. Spoelstra said that Wade reported being "a little sore" in meetings with the training staff before the game. And although Wade wanted to play, the team decided to give him the night off ahead of their Christmas Day matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers. This will be the seventh missed game of the season for Wade after he received OssaTron shock therapy treatment this offseason on his troublesome knee that limited him during the Heat's championship run. The NBA announced on Monday that Wade earned East Player of the Week honors after averaging 25.8 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.8 steals on 60 percent shooting from the floor during the Heat's four-game homestand in which they won all four games. Wade currently ranks first among all qualified shooting guards with a 22.6 Player Efficiency Rating. The Heat hope to get some help from from Heat forward Michael Beasley on Monday, who will suit up with the intention to play after missing his last seven games due to a tight hamstring. On a partially guaranteed contract, Beasley has scored 23.2 points per 36 minutes this season, which ranks second on the team behind LeBron James. A win against the Hawks on Monday would give the Heat their best start in franchise history after 27 games. The defending champs are currently 20-6 and 1Â½ games behind the Indiana Pacers for the top seed in the East.
