NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas -- Former major league pitcher Brad Halsey has died in a recreational climbing accident. He was 33. Police in Comal County said an investigation was still ongoing into Friday's accident in the Texas Hill Country area. The Lux Funeral Home said services were pending. Halsey went 14-19 in 88 games with the New York Yankees, Arizona and Oakland from 2004-06. The left-hander most recently pitched in the minors for the Yankees in 2011. In 2004, Halsey dueled Boston ace Pedro Martinez into the middle innings in a game highlighted by Derek Jeter's diving catch into the stands at Yankee Stadium. In 2006, Halsey gave up Barry Bonds' 714th home run, tying Babe Ruth for second place on the career list. Halsey later joked about the specially marked balls for Bonds' at-bats. "They just have a B and a number on them, and a picture of Barry, too. If you look into his eye, he winks at you," Halsey said.
