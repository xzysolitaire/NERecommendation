The Buffalo Bills are lobbying the New York state legislature to allow earlier beer sales at Ralph Wilson Stadium this season. According to the Buffalo News, the team approached local lawmakers to push for a bill that would permit beer sales beginning at 11 a.m. for Sunday games with a 1 p.m. kickoff. The objective of the measure would be to bring more fans inside the stadium to consume alcohol in a "controlled" environment. Most teams open their stadiums 90 minutes prior to kickoff and start beer sales at that point. Under current law, the Bills cannot sell beer until noon for 1 p.m. games. All eight of the team's home games this season will kick off at 1 p.m. The state's current legislative session is set to close on June 19. A similar bill was proposed two years ago but failed, according to the newspaper. That proposal was resisted by some businesses around the Bills' stadium. .
