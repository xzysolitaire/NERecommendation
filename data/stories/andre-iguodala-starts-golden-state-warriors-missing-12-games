OAKLAND, Calif. -- Andre Iguodala is in the starting lineup for the Golden State Warriors against the New Orleans Pelicans after missing the last 12 games with a right hamstring injury. Iguodala was in his usual spot at small forward for Tuesday night's game, moving Harrison Barnes back into a reserve role. Iguodala participated in the team's morning practice and went through his usual pregame routine on the court. Warriors coach Mark Jackson said Iguodala's minutes would be limited. Iguodala entered the game averaging 12.9 points, 6.3 assists and 4.2 rebounds this season. He also has been Golden State's best perimeter defender. Iguodala hasn't played since injuring his hamstring in a loss at the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 22.
