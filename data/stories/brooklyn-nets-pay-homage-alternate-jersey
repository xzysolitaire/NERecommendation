With their move to Brooklyn, the Nets got rid of blue from their color palette, but in a nod to the tradition of their new home, the team is set to unveil alternate jerseys in the familiar blue and grey from the Brooklyn Dodgers days. The Nets will first wear the blue and grey sleeved jerseys for the game against the Boston Celtics on March 21 and will wear them for four other games, to be called "Brooklyn Blue Nights," before the season is over. The Nets' dance team, the Brooklynettes, will also have costumes that pay tribute to Brooklyn's past on those nights, March 28 against the Cavaliers, April 4 against the Pistons, April 11 against the Hawks and April 15 against the Knicks. The Nets will sell the blue and grey jersey at retail, with prices ranging from $50 to $110. Player T-shirts will cost $32. The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final season in Brooklyn in 1957.
