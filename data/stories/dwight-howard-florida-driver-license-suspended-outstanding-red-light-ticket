Dwight Howard's Florida driver's license has been suspended after he failed to pay a ticket for running a red light, Reuters reported, citing court records. Howard was ticketed 10 times for running red lights in the Orlando area, and received four speeding tickets, 12 citations for failing to pay highway tolls and one citation for failing to change his address on his driver's license, according to the report. All the violations are civil traffic infractions. Howard's license has been suspended since at least Aug. 15 after he failed to pay $285 for an April violation in Winter Park, Reuters reported, although the rest of the cases have been resolved. Howard, 28, now with the Houston Rockets, played for the Orlando Magic from 2004 through 2012.
