CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star guard Kyrie Irving will miss his second straight game because of a bruised left knee. The team said Friday that he will not travel to New York for Saturday's game against the Brooklyn Nets. Irving sat out Thursday's home win over Orlando. Irving was hurt Tuesday while falling awkwardly on a layup against Indiana. He felt a "pop," but an MRI showed no structural damage. The Cavs say their leading scorer will continue to receive treatment. Cleveland hosts the Pacers on Sunday. Irving has had numerous injuries during his two-plus seasons in the NBA. One of his goals was to play in all 82 games this season. Jarrett Jack started for Irving against the Magic.
