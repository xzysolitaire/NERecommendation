MILWAUKEE -- Police have cited Bucks center Larry Sanders for disorderly conduct and assault and battery in a fight last month at a downtown Milwaukee nightclub. The two charges are municipal citations. The Milwaukee County district attorney's office has said it has no plans to issue criminal charges against Sanders. Sanders' attorney, Michael Hart, tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Sanders was not the aggressor in the Nov. 3 altercation. Hart says Sanders has "gotten a bad rap." A court date is set for Jan. 21. A police official tells the newspaper at least one other person would be ticketed in connection with the incident. Sanders is expected to be out for six weeks after surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb suffered in the fight.
