The Washington Wizards, as expected, are closing in on a new contract with coach Randy Wittman after the team's run to the second round of the playoffs, sources confirmed to ESPN.com. NBA.com reported Tuesday night that Wittman is expected to receive a three-year deal worth at least $3 million annually. ESPN.com reported May 16, after Washington's second-round elimination by Indiana, that "all signs point" to Wittman receiving a new deal following Washington's 44 wins and a first-round upset of Chicago. Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, after a news conference Tuesday to announce a new general manager and coach for the NHL's Washington Capitals, which he also owns, said in an interview with the local NBC affiliate in D.C. that Wittman "deserves the opportunity to come back" after doing so well in the final year of his previous contract. "I thought the coach did a very fine job for us," Leonsis said in the NBC interview. "We're sitting down and talking to Randy and his people. Randy did a very fine job. We did all the exit interviews. I'm finding that doing some of the exit interviews are a very good process for us. You learn lots of stuff. The players respected the coach, and they played hard for him. I think he deserves the opportunity to come back and lead us even deeper in the playoffs."
