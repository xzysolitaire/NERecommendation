MANSFIELD, Texas -- Former NFL running back Marion Barber III was detained and taken for a mental health evaluation after police were called to a Dallas suburb. Mansfield police spokesman Thad Penkala said it wasn't clear what led to the calls that prompted a response from police Sunday night. Penkala said officers took Barber to a hospital for a mental health check based on conversations with the former Pro Bowl back. Penkala said Barber was not arrested or facing charges. He said police wouldn't know whether he was still hospitalized because they wouldn't be notified. Barber, 31, spent six of his seven seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before finishing his career in Chicago in 2011. He rushed for 4,780 yards and 53 touchdowns.
