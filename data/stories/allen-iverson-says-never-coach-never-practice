Allen Iverson is in Manila for a charity basketball event, and the local press caught him for a friendly interview. Iverson listed his top five players of all time (in no particular order: Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal), said his 1996 draft class is better than LeBron's, and (with a callback to his famous ''practice'' rant) put to rest any thought of him coaching in the future: Iverson also gave a short preview of the future -- he said that his son Allen ''Deuce'' Iverson is a whole lot better than he was at 16. It helps if the guy teaching you the game is one of the finest guards of all time.
