Andrew Bynum will be out indefinitely due to continued soreness and swelling in his right knee, the Indiana Pacers announced Friday on Twitter. The team said Bynum, acquired in early February, will continue to get treatment. Bynum was traded from Cleveland to Chicago on Jan. 7, then released by the Bulls the next day in a salary-saving move. He signed with Indiana for the remainder of the season for $1 million, a source told ESPN when the deal was reached,Â and has worked with trainers to strengthen his oft-injured knees. The center made his debut with Indiana on March 11 against the Boston Celtics, scoring eight points in 16 minutes. He missed the next game, then scored 15 points in 20 minutes against the Detroit Pistons last Saturday. Bynum had not played in the Pacers' two games this week.
