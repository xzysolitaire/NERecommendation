BEAVERTON, Ore. -- LeBron James had some business to take care of before rejoining the Cleveland Cavaliers for training camp. He was at Nike's corporate headquarters Tuesday for the unveiling of his new shoe, the LeBron 12. It is his first new shoe with Nike since he returned this summer to the Cavs. "I would like this shoe," he joked. "But I love it because it has my name and logo on it." The rollout comes less than two weeks before the four-time league MVP reports to training camp. The Cavs open the season Oct. 30 at home against the New York Knicks. The shoe, his 12th since signing with Nike as a rookie out of high school in 2003, features multicolored hexagonal cushions on the soles. It retails for $200, and versions of it will start hitting stores next month. The NBA superstar, who started his career in Cleveland and led the Miami Heat to two NBA titles, re-signed as a free agent with the Cavaliers in July. His new $41 million contract includes an option after one year, but he said last month that he planned to finish his career with the Cavs. He'll join Kevin Love, who was traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Cavs in late August, and Kyrie Irving, last season's All-Star Game MVP who signed a maximum contract extension on the first day of free agency. Irving also was the MVP at the recent FIBA Basketball World Cup, which the U.S. national team won. James and Love played together on the U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in London, but LeBron was excited about joining Irving, saying: "I think he can be the best point guard in our league." The moves were part of a dramatic summer for the Cavs, who won just 33 games last season and haven't been to the playoffs since James left in 2010. Cleveland also signed free agents Shawn Marion, Mike Miller and James Jones, veteran players with NBA titles on their résumés. "I'm looking forward to being back in downtown Cleveland -- where I belong," James said.
