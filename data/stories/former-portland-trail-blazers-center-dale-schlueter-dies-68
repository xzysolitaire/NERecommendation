PORTLAND, Ore. -- Dale Schlueter, a member of the Portland Trail Blazers for their inaugural 1970-71 season, died Thursday after battling cancer. He was 68. The Trail Blazers said Schlueter died at his Portland home. Schlueter was acquired by the Blazers in 1970 and averaged 8.2 points in the team's first season. The 6-foot-10 center had two stints in Portland, from 1970 to '72 and again for the 1977-78 season. A Washington native who played at Colorado State, Schlueter averaged 5.3 points and 5.2 rebounds in seven NBA seasons with San Francisco, Portland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Buffalo and Phoenix. After retiring in 1978, Schlueter remained involved with the Blazers and served as a team ambassador at games and community events. Blazers founder Harry Glickman remembered Schlueter as giving his ultimate effort every time he played. Funeral arrangements are pending.
