A jersey worn by LeBron James during the second half of his regular season return to Cleveland last month sold for $50,040 on Thursday night. The jersey, auctioned by the NBA, was used by James on Oct. 30, for the Cavaliers' season opener against the New York Knicks. James didn't play well in the game, scoring 17 points on 5-for-15 shooting in the 95-90 loss. Other jerseys that sold on Thursday from that game included those of Kevin Love ($2,595) and Kyrie Irving ($5,761). The NBA last auctioned off a Miami Heat jersey that James wore for the first half of Game 1 of last year's NBA Finals. That jersey sold for $50,020.
