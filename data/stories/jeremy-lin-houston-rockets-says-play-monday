HOUSTON -- Houston guard James Harden is out for a second straight game for the Rockets against the Mavericks, but Jeremy Lin will play after missing time with back spasms. Harden, who leads the team in scoring with 23.9 points a game, will sit out Monday night with a sprained left ankle. Lin has missed four games recently with back spasms. The Rockets are also without guard Patrick Beverley, who has a right hand injury and center Omer Asik, who has missed the last nine games with a right thigh bruise. "It is what it is and we just have to play through it," Dwight Howard said, according to the Houston Chronicle. "It is a long season. There are going to be a lot of injuries."
