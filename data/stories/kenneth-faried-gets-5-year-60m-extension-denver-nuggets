Kenneth Faried reached a five-year, $60 million extension with the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night, Yahoo! Sports reports, citing sources. The 24-year-old forward will make no less than $52 million over the duration of the contract thanks to a partial guarantee in the fifth year, according to Yahoo! Sports. Faried, who played for the U.S. during its gold-medal run at the 2014 FIBA World Cup of Basketball, averaged 13.7 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. He was the 22nd overall pick in the 2011 draft.
