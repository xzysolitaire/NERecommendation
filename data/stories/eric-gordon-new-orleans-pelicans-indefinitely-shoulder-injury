METAIRIE, La. -- The New Orleans Pelicans say guard Eric Gordon's left shoulder injury will sideline him indefinitely. Team officials say an MRI has revealed that Gordon tore his labrum when he separated his shoulder in a collision with Jazz guard Trey Burke during Saturday night's victory in Utah. Gordon, who missed 115 games with various injuries during his first three seasons in New Orleans, has started all 12 of the Pelicans' games this season, averaging 9.5 points, 2.3 rebounds and two assists in 31 minutes per game. His scoring average and field goal percentage of 39.8 this season are well below his career averages of 17.2 points per game and 44.1 percent. Gordon is in the third year of a four-year $58 million contract, with a salary of $14.9 million this season.
