MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves will be without center Nikola Pekovic for a while. Pekovic had an MRI test Tuesday on his right ankle that revealed bursitis, which is inflammation of the fluid-filled pad that cushions the joint. The Timberwolves announced the 6-foot-11, 285-pound Pekovic will be kept off the court for seven to 10 days before being re-evaluated. Pekovic was hurt in the first quarter Monday at Chicago. The Wolves have seven games in the next 10 days. They've won four of their last five, but they haven't been above .500 since Nov. 25. The 28-year-old Pekovic, after signing a five-year, $60 million contract this summer, is averaging a career-high 18.4 points and 9.3 rebounds this season. After missing 39 games over the past three seasons with various injuries, he was finally healthy. Ronny Turiaf will start in his place. The loss of Pekovic comes amid a campaign by the Timberwolves to get their big center voted into next month's All-Star Game along with Minnesota power forward Kevin Love, who fans voted in a starter for the West last week.Â The Wolves had sent NBA coaches a vinyl-album package featuring the "Bruise Brothers," which is the nickname for their physical duo of Pekovic and Love.
