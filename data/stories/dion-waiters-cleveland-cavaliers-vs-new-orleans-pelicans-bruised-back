CLEVELAND --Â Cavaliers guard Dion Waiters missed Monday night's 118-111 win over the New Orleans Pelicans because of a bruised lower back. Waiters was listed as day to day, and coach David Blatt said he hopes Waiters will be able to play Friday in Boston against the Celtics. Rookie Joe Harris received the lion's share of Waiters' playing time against New Orleans, putting up five points, one rebound and one assist in 20 minutes. Waiters was injured Friday night when he got shoved by Denver Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur as he went in for a layup. Arthur was charged with a flagrant foul, ejected and suspended by the NBA one game without pay for the incident. Waiters scored a season-high 17 points in Cleveland's win. Waiters began the season in Cleveland's starting lineup. But he was moved to the second unit by first-year coach Blatt, who needed more scoring from his bench. Waiters averaged 15.9 points per game coming off the bench last season. Waiters is averaging 9.4 points for the Cavs, who played just their second home game Monday night following a four-game road trip.
