TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston referenced the Johnny Manziel media days circus last year as an outsider looking in. He might be in the middle of it this year. The reigning Heisman winner will attend the 2014 ACC Football Kickoff, as the conference released the list of 28 players -- two from each of the 14 teams -- that will speak with reporters during media days, which take place July 20-21. There was uncertainty whether Florida State would have Winston attend considering the off-the-field issues and scrutiny the redshirt sophomore has faced since he was investigated for a sexual assault in November. Winston was not charged. In April, Winston was cited for shoplifting seafood at a local grocery store and served a short suspension while with the baseball team. Football coach Jimbo Fisher said Winston would not serve any additional punishment and is cleared for practice and the Seminoles' opener against Oklahoma State on Aug. 30. Winston has not talked much publicly since speaking with reporters at the conclusion of spring practice Apr. 12. He was honored in his hometown of Hueytown, Alabama, on Saturday and had his high school and youth football jerseys retired. Manziel was the focus of media days even outside of the SEC last July, as Winston was asked a question about contracting the off-the-field "Manziel disease" while at the 2013 ACC Football Kickoff. He responded with a joke, telling reporters to "get your mikes and start slapping me on the head" if he garnered similar notoriety. Cornerback P.J. Williams will join Winston as Florida State's player representatives. Fisher will also speak.
