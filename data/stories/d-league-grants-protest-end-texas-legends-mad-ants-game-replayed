NEW YORK -- The NBA Development League has granted a protest filed by Fort Wayne, ruling that the final 0.9 seconds of its Nov. 22 game against the Texas Legends should be replayed after the Mad Ants were incorrectly called for a technical foul. The Mad Ants called timeout with 0.9 seconds left and the game tied at 99. An official scoring error led them to believe they had a timeout left, but because they didn't, the Legends were awarded a free throw that Chris Douglas-Roberts made for the winning point. Fort Wayne protested and the league said Friday that a Mad Ants timeout was incorrectly recorded by the official scorer with 10:35 left. It was the second protest granted by the NBA D-League in its 13-year history. The date and location of the conclusion will be determined later.
