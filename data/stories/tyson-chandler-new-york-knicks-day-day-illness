NEW YORK -- Knicks center Tyson Chandler missed Thursday night's game against the Miami Heat with an upper respiratory illness, according to coach Mike Woodson. Chandler has missed two games due to illness. His availability for Saturday's game against Philadelphia is unclear at this point, with Woodson calling him day to day. The Knicks also were without point guard Beno Udrih on Thursday. Udrih suffered a knee injury in the team's win against Detroit on Tuesday. An MRI taken Wednesday revealed that Udrih has inflammation of the left tibiofibular joint. Woodson said the point guard is day to day. With Udrih out, rookie Toure' Murry likely will play more minutes at backup point guard. Metta World Peace (knee) and Pablo Prigioni (toe) also were out for the Knicks (12-22). Prigioni has been out since Dec. 16 with a broken toe. He said he had an X-Ray on the injury earlier this week and hopes to start running later this week. He is likely out for at least another seven days. Jeremy Tyler originally wasn't going to play Thursday night due to personal reasons but he was in the Knicks' lineup. Kenyon Martin started at center with Chandler out. Martin missed the team's shootaround on Thursday due to an illness that has affected several Knicks but will be available against Miami. Chandler first came down with the illness on Sunday. He left the Knicks game against Dallas that night in the first quarter and has not practiced or played since.
