The Minnesota Twins have offered Paul Molitor a contract to be their next manager, according to multiple reports. Barring any snags in final negotiations, the Twins will introduce Molitor during a news conference on Tuesday, the reports say. Molitor, along with Torey Lovullo, was one of the final candidates in the running to replace Ron Gardenhire, who was fired after 13 seasons and 383 losses over the last four seasons. The Twins added Molitor to their staff in October 2013, assigning him supervision of the team's baserunning, bunting, infield instruction and positioning as well as assistance with in-game strategy. In July, he became the team's first-base coach after a hip injury to Joe Vavra, the team's regular third-base coach. Before last season, Molitor had served as a minor league base running and infield coordinator for the organization since 2005. Molitor was a candidate to be Minnesota's manager in 2002 after Tom Kelly retired, but he withdrew during the unsettling process during which Major League Baseball tried to eliminate the franchise before being blocked in court. The job eventually went to Gardenhire. Molitor played three seasons (1996-98) with the Twins to cap his 21-year Hall of Fame career. He never has managed in the majors or minor leagues but has coached extensively since leaving baseball as a player.
