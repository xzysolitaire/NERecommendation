CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Coach Steve Clifford says starting power forward Marvin Williams will miss the next two games with a strained left shoulder, adding to the Charlotte Hornets' injury woes. Cody Zeller, who has elevated his play in his second NBA season, started Friday night against Golden State. Jason Maxiell also was expected to see additional playing time off the bench. Williams injured his shoulder in the first half of Charlotte's loss Wednesday night to the Portland Trail Blazers and did not return. Small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and guard Gary Neal remain out with injuries for Charlotte, but guard P.J. Hairston played Friday despite a thumb injury. David Lee (hamstring) remains out for Golden State, but Leandro Barbosa was set to return after missing Wednesday night's game with a sprained knee.
