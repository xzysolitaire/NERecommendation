Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul will not play Friday night against the Sacramento Kings, according to coach Doc Rivers. Paul strained his right hamstring in the third quarter of the Clippers' 93-80 win over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night and did not return to the game. He was cleared by trainers to return to the game late in the fourth quarter and said at the time that he planned to play against the Kings. Darren Collison will get the start at point guard Friday night. Paul, who had 15 points and seven assists in 26 minutes Wednesday night, left the game with 3:19 remaining in the third quarter and went back to the locker room. He returned to the Clippers' bench late in the fourth quarter with his right hamstring heavily taped. At that point, the Clippers had taken a commanding lead and there was no need for him to re-enter the game.
