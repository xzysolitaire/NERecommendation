Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY SportsThe Kings will continue to build around DeMarcus Cousins, a franchise investment. NBA Insiders Amin Elhassan and Bradford Doolittle break down the draft profile, needs and potential picks of the 14 teams eligible for the NBA draft lottery this year. With some help from Chad Ford's Big Board of top 30 prospects, we take a look at the Sacramento Kings. Personnel Needs: Passing, shot-blocking, deep shooting Major need: The Kings have invested heavily in the future of DeMarcus Cousins as a franchise player, and hope to do the same to keep Rudy Gay around as his primary running mate. Gay can opt out this summer, but Kings general manager Pete D'Alessandro has pledged to keep him around. That being the case, the Kings' third big investment needs to be in the backcourt. Isaiah Thomas is a terrific scorer, but on a team lacking in playmakers, he's more suited to create for himself as a bench player than to team with the high-usage duo of Cousins and Gay. Ben McLemore had a poor rookie season, but time is on his side to become an answer at the 2. So the Kings can either target a playmaking point guard in the draft with the pick tentatively slotted at No. 7, or a shot-blocking big man who can play either frontcourt position, as can Cousins. For his part, D'Alessandro has pledged to take the best player available. To read more of the Sacramento Kings' 2014 NBA draft guide, become an Insider today.
