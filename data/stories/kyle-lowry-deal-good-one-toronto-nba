If the first 48 hours of free agency have demonstrated anything, it's that there's little connection between the markets for different players. Each free agent's contract is the product of a unique confluence of market forces, with value to the team a relatively small factor. So retire the concept that if one player is worth X, another must be worth Y. The latest evidence against the theory of market value came with Kyle Lowry reportedly agreeing Wednesday night to stay with the Toronto Raptors on a four-year, $48 million contract. Amid the sea of financial excess that has been the first two days of free agency, the Lowry contract stands out as an island of sanity.
