NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans All-Star forward Anthony DavisÂ sat out Wednesday night's 94-88 loss to Phoenix because of back spasms. Davis has been playing through back pain recently; it limited him to only 11 minutes in a loss at Denver last Wednesday and 23 minutes in a loss at Utah on Friday night. Davis played 34 minutes in a loss at Portland on Sunday, and coach Monty Williams says Davis wants to keep playing, but the team has decided he needs more rest. Davis is averaging 20.8 points, 10 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game. His absence came as New Orleans extended a skid to six games against the Suns, who are trying to secure one of the final playoff spots in the Western Conference.
