Joel Embiid is expected to miss five to eight months -- and possibly the entire season -- after undergoing foot surgery, but in the early days of free agency he tried to help the Philadelphia 76ers ... by recruiting LeBron James on Twitter. Sadly, after four days, Embiid abandoned his quest, but not before entertaining fans and gaining plenty of new followers on the social media platform. Finally, after Embiid had given up the quest, James finally responded. At least, we'd like to imagine that's what this tweet was about. (Sadly, it wasn't.)
