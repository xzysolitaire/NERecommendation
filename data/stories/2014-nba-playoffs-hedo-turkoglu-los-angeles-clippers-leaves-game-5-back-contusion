LOS ANGELES -- Clippers forward Hedo Turkoglu suffered a lower back contusion in the third quarter of Tuesday's Game 5, 113-103 win over the Golden State Warriors and did not return. Turkoglu, 35, was defending David Lee in midair when he was knocked to the ground as Lee picked up an offensive foul with 7:47 left in the third quarter. As players tried to pick Turkoglu up, he brushed them off as he was writhing in pain during the duration of a timeout before being helped back to the locker room. Turkoglu will be re-evaluated by the team on Wednesday.
