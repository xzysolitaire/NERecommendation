CHICAGO -- D.J. Augustin was not with Chicago Bulls as they prepared to face the Orlando Magic on Monday night because of personal reasons, according to Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau. According to the Bulls pregame radio broadcast on ESPN 1000, Augustin's wife gave birth Monday to a baby boy. Augustin's absence meant more minutes for Bulls guard Jimmer Fredette, who hasn't seen the floor much since signing with the team in March. He scored 17 points on 7-of-14 shooting in 31 minutes. Augustin, who has been described as a "season saver" by his teammates and coaches, is averaging 13 points and 4.4 assists a game since signing with the Bulls in December.
