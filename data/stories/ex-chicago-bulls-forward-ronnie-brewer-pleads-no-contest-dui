LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors say former Chicago Bulls forward Ronnie Brewer has been sentenced to probation after pleading no contest to driving drunk in Beverly Hills. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office says the 29-year-old Brewer entered the plea to the misdemeanor charge through an attorney Tuesday. Prosecutors had alleged he was driving at about twice the legal blood-alcohol limit when he was pulled over near Rodeo Drive in February. A judge immediately sentenced Brewer to three years of summary probation and fined him $390. He was also ordered to attend alcohol abuse classes and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Brewer has played for six NBA teams since the Utah Jazz drafted him in 2006, including two stints with the Bulls, who released him last month.
