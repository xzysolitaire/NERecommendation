The Boston Celtics unveiled an alternate logo for the 2014-15 season on Monday, producing a silhouetted logo featuring the team's Lucky the Leprechaun mascot. Said the team in a news release: "The goal in creating the logo was to extend the Celtics brand with a symbol reflecting the rich tradition of the organization throughout its history, yet versatile enough to work across various formats and products." The Celtics said the new logo reflects the leprechaun logo from the 1960s illustrated by Celtics legend Red Auerbach's brother, Zang. The new logo will not be use on game uniforms, but the Celtics made one uniform switch for the 2014-15 season. Their road jerseys will now read "BOSTON" on the front rather than "CELTICS." Also, all teams that have won NBA titles will have a gold tab on the back of their jerseys indicating those titles.
