The Atlanta Hawks have reached an agreement with free agent Thabo Sefolosha on a three-year, $12 million deal, sources told ESPN.com on Thursday. The Hawks were looking to add a wing player who could be a defensive specialist after trading away Lou Williams to the Toronto Raptors last week. Sefolosha, 30, averaged 6.3 points and 3.6 rebounds in 61 starts for the Oklahoma City Thunder last season. RealGM first reported the agreement.
