BALTIMORE -- Suspended slugger Chris Davis won't be playing in the AL Championship Series for the Baltimore Orioles. Manager Buck Showalter said Thursday that Davis will be omitted from the 25-man roster, which must be submitted on Friday morning before the Orioles host the Kansas City Royals in Game 1. Davis was suspended for 25 games by Major League Baseball on Sept. 12 for testing positive for Adderall, a banned amphetamine. His suspension included the final 17 games of the regular season and Baltimore's three-game sweep of Detroit in the AL Division Series, meaning the first baseman has five games left to serve. "We're not going to play with 24 for five games," Showalter said. The only way Davis could play if the ALCS reaches six games is if he replaces an injured teammate on the roster. Showalter said he would re-assess the situation if the Orioles advance to the World Series. "If we're fortunate enough to continue to play, then we'll revisit it," he said.
