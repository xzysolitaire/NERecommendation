Hoops lovers like us claim that no other sport's offseason is so much fun. We go from crowning a champion to drafting the next crop of rookies to setting the next salary cap to the free-agent bazaar to summer league, and in years like these, we even get a little international competition to boot. Nevertheless, thank God Shammgod it's finally over, because the real games are back: The NBA's 69th season tips off tonight with three intriguing games. A three-game docket is more like tapas than a full meal, but we'll take it. I miss the old custom of opening on Friday night with a full panorama of games, which hasn't happened since 1997. For one thing, under that arrangement the league got the sports world to itself, whereas tonight it's up against Game 6 of the World Series. But NBA marketers are savvy and have learned how to focus our attention on the key storylines entering a given season. Narrative matters to the schedule-makers. That's why the defending champ always opens at home, so it can raise its banner in a fitting cap on the previous season. It's also in service of narrative that a key subplot like LeBron James' Cleveland re-debut will be Thursday, when it will have its own spotlight. As for Tuesday, we're getting a lot of new faces in new places, in contrast with the Spurs, the closest thing to a constant we have in professional sports.
