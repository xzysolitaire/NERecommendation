PHOENIX -- Phoenix Suns guard Isaiah Thomas has undergone arthroscopic surgery on his left wrist. The team says he's expected to be able to participate fully in the team's training camp. The Suns say the procedure was done Thursday in New York by Dr. Michelle Carlson at the Hospital for Special Surgeries. The Suns acquired Thomas in a sign-and-trade deal with the Sacramento Kings on July 12.
