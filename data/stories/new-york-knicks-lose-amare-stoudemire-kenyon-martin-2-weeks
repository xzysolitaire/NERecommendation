NEW YORK -- The New York Knicks have lost Amar'e Stoudemire and Kenyon Martin for up to two weeks after MRI results confirmed diagnoses for the power forwards stemming from injuries sustained in a Thursday loss. The Knicks said Martin has a left ankle sprain and tendinitis. He is expected to be out approximately two weeks. Stoudemire tweeted Friday that he "should be able to return to action in a week or two." The Knicks later confirmed Stoudemire's announcement and said he is "expected to be out approximately two weeks." Stoudemire suffered an ankle injury in the second half of the loss to the Indiana Pacers. Initial X-rays on the injury were negative. "I'm going to bounce back from this and get back to what I was before. Hopefully I'll be back sooner than later," Stoudemire said after Thursday's game. Stoudemire's injury looms large for the Knicks. The power forward averaged 13.2 points on 56 percent shooting in 23 minutes over his past 12 games. Martin had given the Knicks solid rim protection during Tyson Chandler's recent absence due to illness. Coach Mike Woodson expects to use center Cole Aldrich and forward/center Jeremy Tyler more often with Stoudemire and Martin out. Martin has had issues in the past with his left ankle. The team's medical staff limited his minutes during training camp and in the early portion of the regular season due to concerns over a lingering ankle injury. Those restrictions were lifted in mid-November. Martin, 36, is averaging 4.2 points and 4.4 rebounds in 20.3 minutes per game.
