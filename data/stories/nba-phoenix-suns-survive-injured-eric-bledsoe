The feel-good story of the 2013-14 NBA season was dealt a blow Thursday when ESPN.com's Marc Stein reported that Phoenix Suns starting guard Eric Bledsoe will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Bledsoe and fellow guard Goran Dragic had been the leaders of the Suns' unexpected run at a playoff spot, an effort the Suns will now have to continue without Bledsoe for an indefinite period. Stein reports that a timetable for Bledsoe's return won't be known until doctors actually operate on his right knee, and if possible they could opt to repair his torn cartilage rather than remove it, similar to the cases of fellow point guards Derrick Rose (in November) and Russell Westbrook (in May). That would mean a longer timetable for Bledsoe that could end his season. To read more of Kevin Pelton's assessment of Eric Bledsoe's injury, become an Insider today.
