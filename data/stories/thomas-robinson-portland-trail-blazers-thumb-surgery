PORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland Trail Blazers forward Thomas Robinson has undergone surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. Robinson hurt his thumb last week during NBA Summer League play. He is expected to return in time for the Blazers' fall training camp. The 6-foot-10 forward averaged 4.8 points and 4.4 rebounds in 70 games last season with the Blazers.
