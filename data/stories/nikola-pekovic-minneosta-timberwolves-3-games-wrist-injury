MINNEAPOLIS -- Timberwolves center Nikola Pekovic will miss at least the next three games because of a sprained right wrist. Coach Flip Saunders made the announcement on Tuesday. Pekovic was injured last week against Dallas. He will not play in home games this week against the Knicks, Spurs and Kings. Saunders says Pekovic will be re-evaluated at the start of next week. It's the latest injury for the oft-injured big man from Montenegro. Pekovic has missed huge chunks of time with various foot and ankle ailments over the last two seasons. Saunders also says power forward Thaddeus Young will miss the next three games after the sudden death of Young's mother last week. Backup center Ronny Turiaf is still out with an injured hip as well.
