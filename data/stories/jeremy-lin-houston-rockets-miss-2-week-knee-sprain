Houston Rockets guard Jeremy Lin will miss two weeks with a right knee sprain, the team announced Friday on its Twitter feed. Lin, who was injured in the first quarter of Wednesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks after colliding with Paul Millsap, will be reevaluated after the two-week period. Lin had started the last three games in place of James Harden, who has missed the last three games with a sore foot. In 16 games this season, Lin is averaging 15.3 points and 4.5 assists. The Rockets have depth at point guard with Patrick Beverley and Aaron Brooks, who scored 21 points in the 113-84 win against the Hawks. Harden, averaging 24.2 points, is considered a game-time decision for Friday's game against the Nets.
