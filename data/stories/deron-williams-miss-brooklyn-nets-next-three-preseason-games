NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets point guard Deron Williams said Thursday that he'll miss the team's next three preseason games as he continues to recover from a sprained right ankle. Williams said he will not play against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday, the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday and the Boston Celtics on Tuesday. Williams could make his preseason debut Oct. 17 against the Miami Heat. The Nets open the regular season on Oct. 30 in Cleveland. "[My ankle's] getting better everyday," Williams said after signing autographs at a Nets community event in Brooklyn. "(We're) taking it slow, but with the goal of being ready for Game 1 [of the regular season]." Williams hurt his ankle during an offseason workout in Utah. Nets coach Jason Kidd said Thursday that Williams is only doing some light shooting. Kidd did not have a timetable as far as when his point guard would return to full-contact practice.
