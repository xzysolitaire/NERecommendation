SAN DIEGO -- San Diego Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera was charged with resisting arrest after being stopped for suspicion of driving under the influence of marijuana. The San Diego County district attorney's office said Thursday the 27-year-old Cabrera faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail if convicted of the misdemeanor. The office also cited him for possession of marijuana in a car, a vehicle code infraction that carries a fine of $100. The California Highway Patrol arrested Cabrera on Sept. 3 on suspicion of driving under the influence of marijuana. Steve Walker, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said prosecutors do not plan DUI charges. Cabrera is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 8 on the charges, which were filed Monday. Walker didn't know if Cabrera had an attorney. In a statement released to The Associated Press, the Padres said: "We are deeply troubled by the charges filed today against Everth Cabrera. We will defer to the judicial system to resolve the legal aspects of this case. As it relates to his future with the Padres, we will make a determination in the near future." Cabrera, an All-Star in 2013, was on the disabled list at the time of his arrest. He was suspended by Major League Baseball for the final 50 games of the 2013 season for his role in the Biogenesis drug scandal. Cabrera led the National League with 44 stolen bases in 2012. He batted .232 this year with three homers, 20 RBIs and 18 steals in 90 games.
