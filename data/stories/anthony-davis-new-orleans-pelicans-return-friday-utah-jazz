SALT LAKE CITY -- Anthony Davis, who has been battling back spasms and left Wednesday's game in Denver in the first half, started for New Orleans against the Utah Jazz on Friday. Also, Eric Gordon did not play because of left knee tendinitis. Brian Roberts and Tyreke Evans started at guard for New Orleans, which has dropped three in a row after a five-game winning streak. Davis, who averages 21.1 points and 10.2 rebounds, played only 11 minutes against the Nuggets and his absence was felt as the Pelicans allowed season highs in points (137) and field goal shooting (56.5). Davis scored six points and grabbed three rebounds before leaving the game in the second quarter, with his team trailing by double digits. Davis missed the game at San Antonio last Saturday with a sprained ankle, but had 22 points against Sacramento on Monday.
