PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Clippers could be signing veteran forward Hedo Turkoglu soon, coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday. "We could. We're looking at him strong. I can say that much," Rivers said. The Clippers brought in Turkoglu for a meeting and a workout Thursday and liked what they saw. The Clippers signed point guards Darius Morris and Maalik Wayns to 10-day contracts last week. Their deals will expire before the Clippers' start a 12-day, seven-game road trip Thursday, when Turkoglu potentially could sign. "He made shots from everywhere," Rivers said after the free agent's workout. "He looked good. It was a good workout." Turkoglu, who was cut by the Orlando Magic earlier this month, hasn't played this season and played in only 11 games last season because of injuries and a 20-game suspension for use of performance-enhancing drugs. Rivers and the Clippers have had their eyes on Turkoglu since he became available. "I just like him as a player," Rivers said last week. "I think he's out there and we should look at him. I've always liked him. He can play [the] three and four. It's a position that we can use in some ways, so we're looking." Rivers also said forward Reggie Bullock, who has been out since Dec. 7 with a sprained left ankle, will be back in uniform on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks.
