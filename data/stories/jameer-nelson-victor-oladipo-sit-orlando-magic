ORLANDO, Fla. -- Orlando will be without guards Jameer Nelson and Victor Oladipo when the Magic host the Rockets. Nelson is out with an illness and Oladipo is sidelined Wednesday with a sore left ankle. For Oladipo it is his first missed game of the season. The rookie guard is the only Magic player to appear in all 62 games. Magic coach Jacque Vaughn says Oladipo's injury doesn't stem from a specific incident, but is general soreness. Shooting guard Arron Afflalo is returning to the starting lineup after missing the previous five games with a sprained right ankle. Ronnie Price will start in place of Nelson at point guard.
