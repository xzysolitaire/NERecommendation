ATLANTA -- Hawks guard Lou WilliamsÂ returned to the court for the first time since undergoing reconstructive right knee surgery 10 months ago. Williams, in his second season with Atlanta, was cheered when he entered Friday night's 113-103 victory over Philadelphia midway through the first quarter. He finished with seven points, three rebounds and two assists in 15 minutes. Williams averaged 11.6 points in the first eight years of his career. Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer says Williams will not play on consecutive nights. The Hawks visit the New York Knicks on Saturday. Budenholzer decided to bring forward Paul Millsap, Atlanta's second-leading scorer, off the bench against the 76ers. Gustavo Ayon started in his season debut, but Millsap replaced him early in the first.
