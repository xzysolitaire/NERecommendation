OK, so this isn't a very difficult forecast: LeBron James should and will win the NBA Most Valuable Player award. What's interesting in the MVP category is what happens down the ballot, especially for a superstar in an empire state of mind. Carmelo Anthony's name popped up a lot on our ballots -- in the category of who get MVP votes, the red-hot New York Knicks forward moved all the way up to fourth in the voting. If the NBA's balloting goes the same way, it would be Melo's first-ever top-five finish in the MVP voting and only his second top-10 appearance in his 10 seasons in the league. Otherwise the top five consists of the usual suspects: LeBron, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. These results come from votes by our ESPN Forecast panel.
