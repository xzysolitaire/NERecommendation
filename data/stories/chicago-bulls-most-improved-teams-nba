Other than the Cleveland Cavaliers, whose offseason moves have improved them the most? George Karl: Be aware, the Chicago Bulls have the best talent they've had on their team around Derrick Rose since he's been there. Joakim Noah made a major step forward as a big-time player and a leader of that team. I think Doug McDermott is going to be perfect for that roster. Pau Gasol will figure out how to help them win games. Their team has more talent -- "winning championships talent" instead of just "winning basketball games" talent -- than they ever had before.
