Golden State Warriors center Jermaine O'Neal, who suffered a sprained right knee on what he called a "dirty play" by Los Angeles Clippers big man Glen Davis, is questionable for Game 7 on Saturday night in Los Angeles. O'Neal had an MRI exam Friday which revealed a bone bruise to his right kneecap. "Anything short of God coming back and rapture -- anything short of that, I will play," O'Neal said Thursday night. O'Neal suffered the injury during the Warriors' 100-99 victory Thursday night when Davis lowered his shoulder and crashed into him while going for a rebound in the second quarter. "It's just a dirty play, to be quite honest," O'Neal told USA Today. "I mean, I'm not going to go try to dive into somebody's legs. It wasn't a scramble for the ball. I respect people's ability to come out and perform and take care of their family based on their bodies. "Either he has terrible balance as a pro athlete, or that was a dirty play. God don't like ugly." The 35-year-old O'Neal, who is averaging 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in the series, stayed on the court before limping to the locker with the help of teammates. Golden State is already without centers Andrew Bogut (fractured rib) and Festus Ezeli (knee surgery).
