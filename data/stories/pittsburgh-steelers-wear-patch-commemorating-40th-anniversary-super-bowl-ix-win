Forty years ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers had never won a world title. That all changed in Super Bowl IX, when they beat the Minnesota Vikings, 16-6, kicking off their now-legendary run of four championships in six seasons. The Steelers will commemorate the 40th anniversary of their first title on Nov. 30, when they'll wear a championship anniversary patch for their game against the New Orleans Saints. The patch will not be worn for other games during the 2014 season -- only for the game on Nov. 30. Championship anniversary patches have been worn periodically by MLB teams, but they're rare in the NFL. The Jets have worn patches commemorating their Super Bowl III victory twice -- in 1993 and again in 2008. And the Dolphins wore a patch marking the 30th anniversary of their perfect 17-0 season in 2002.
