LOS ANGELES -- Clippers guard Jamal Crawford missed his third straight game with a strained left calf and forward Jared Dudley will miss his first game of the season with back spasms Thursday night against the Los Angeles Lakers. Both players could be back as early as Saturday, when the Clippers next play against the Atlanta Hawks. "He's doing OK, he's moving a lot better today," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of Dudley. "He's moving a lot better with the back spasms." Crawford was on the court shooting before the game without any pain. Rivers said there's a good chance he would be back on Saturday. "He's close," Rivers said. "I wouldn't be surprised if he played in our next game. I don't know that. That's just my feeling."
