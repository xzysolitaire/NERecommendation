CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Milwaukee Bucks announced moments after tipoff Friday night that reserve forward Caron Butler would not play against the Charlotte Bobcats due to a swollen left knee. The Bucks had not indicated before the game that Butler's knee was a problem. They went on to lose their 11th straight game, 92-76. Butler is averaging 13.2 points per game off the bench for the Bucks. Bobcats forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist also sat out with plantar fasciitis in his right foot, and Jeff Taylor started in his place, scoring four points and adding two assists in 28 minutes. Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said Kidd-Gilchrist spent Thursday with his foot in a boot and that last year's No. 2 overall draft pick wasn't able to participate in Friday morning's shootaround. Clifford said Kidd-Gilchrist would be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. Kidd-Gilchrist is averaging 9.5 points and 5.4 rebounds. Taylor is averaging 8.8 points and 2.4 rebounds as a reserve.
