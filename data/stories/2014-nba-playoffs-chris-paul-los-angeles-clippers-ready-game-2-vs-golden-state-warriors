PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul said his hamstring has responded well to round-the-clock treatment and he will be ready to play Monday night in Game 2 of the team's first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center. Paul initially injured his right hamstring late in the first half of the Clippers' 109-105 Game 1 loss to the Warriors on Saturday. He briefly came out of the game on two separate occasions late in the second quarter, but returned to play 18 minutes in the second half of the loss. Since then, he said he's gotten round the clock treatment for the past 48 hours. "As much as we possibly could," Paul said when asked how much treatment he's gotten since Saturday. "We've got the best training staff in the league. I'll be ready tonight." Paul has a history of injuries in the playoffs. He also has a history of playing through just about anything. "Only thing I couldn't play through was the shoulder thing," Paul said of the separated shoulder that cost him six weeks between January and February. "This is fine." The third-seeded Clippers have had 48 hours to recover and readjust after their upset loss in Game 1. Guard J.J. Redick said he noticed a shift in the Clippers' attitude from Sunday to Monday and feels good about their chances Monday night. "There's got to be a great sense of urgency, and we have that," Redick said. "Anytime you get down, the next game is of the utmost importance, and I sense that with our team. I think yesterday we were a little down. We felt like we had squandered a game, we didn't value it as much as we should have. But we have the right mindset going into Game 2."
