MINNEAPOLIS -- Sacramento center DeMarcus Cousins was scratched from the Kings' game Sunday night against Minnesota because of tendinitis in his right knee. Cousins played in the game against Chicago on Saturday night, scoring 25 points and grabbing 14 rebounds in the loss to the Bulls. The Kings say he is day to day. It's the ninth game Cousins has missed because of injury this season. Aaron Gray started in Cousins' place against Minnesota. The Timberwolves were also without their starting center. Nikola Pekovic sat out because of bursitis in his right ankle, a condition that caused him to miss 13 games earlier in the season. The injury flared up in a loss to Charlotte on Friday night. Pekovic also is listed as day to day.
