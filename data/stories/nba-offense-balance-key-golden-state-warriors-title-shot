The apparent decline of the Oklahoma City Thunder, at least during a regular season hampered by injuries to stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, leaves something of a power vacuum at the top of the Western Conference. And while there's no shortage of candidates to claim the top-three spot in the conference potentially left vacant, no team is better positioned to do so than the 3-0 Golden State Warriors, who face the Los Angeles ClippersÂ on Wednesday night in an early Pacific Division showdown. To ascend in the West, the Warriors must walk a tightrope by improving their offense without suffering a decline on defense.
