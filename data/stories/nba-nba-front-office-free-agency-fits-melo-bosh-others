Together, they simulate a conversation that an actual front office might have. Today, the group weighs in on where Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh should sign, which moves might surprise you, and whether Kyle Lowry made the right call. Want in on the conversation? Use #NBAFrontOffice. 1. Does Carmelo Anthony fit better with the New York Knicks or the Los Angeles Lakers? David Thorpe: Fit? Neither, presently. Those two teams have a lot of evolving left to do before we can know which would be better for Carmelo long-term. But from an off-the-court perspective, I think he fits better with the Knicks. Making his family happy was a big reason he wanted to go to New York a few years ago, so why would he leave now? Plus, Phil Jackson is a decent bet to create a better culture than they've had to this point. Chad Ford: I like him in L.A. I think the Lakers have more flexibility to build a team that fits Melo. The biggest question is whether Kobe Bryant will be healthy. He takes up so much cap space. If he can't return to form, he kills the Lakers' ability to contend for as long as he's on the books. If Melo is fine with that risk, L.A. is the place to go. To see the rest of this super-sized edition of 5-on-5 and to gain access to the rest of Insider's NBA Front Office content, subscribe today.
