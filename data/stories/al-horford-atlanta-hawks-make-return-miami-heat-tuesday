Al Horford will start for the Atlanta Hawks in Tuesday night's preseason game against the Miami Heat, marking his return to the court since suffering a torn right pectoral muscle on Dec. 26 of last season. Prior to the injury, Horford was having another solid season, averaging 18.6 points and 8.4 rebounds. Horford has primarily played center. However, Hawks coach Mike BudenholzerÂ may shift him to power forward at times this season.
