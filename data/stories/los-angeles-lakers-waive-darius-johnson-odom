EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Lakers have waived guard Darius Johnson-Odom, trimming their training camp roster to 16 players. The Lakers announced the move Wednesday. Johnson-Odom was a second-round draft pick by Los Angeles in 2012. He played in four games for the Lakers last season, spending most of the year in the D-League and Russia. Johnson-Odom played in three preseason games with the Lakers this fall. The Lakers are in the middle of a weeklong trip to China for two exhibition games against the Golden State Warriors.
