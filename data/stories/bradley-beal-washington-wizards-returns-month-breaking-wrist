WASHINGTON -- Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal made his season debut Wednesday night in a 105-102 loss to the Dallas Mavericks after being sidelined since breaking his left wrist in early October. Beal, who led the Wizards with 21 points in 26 minutes, shooting 9-for-17 with three 3-pointers, had wrist surgery last month and only began practicing this week. After missing Washington's first nine games, Beal was on the active roster for the first time. He entered the game as a substitute with about five minutes left in the first quarter and was greeted by a standing ovation from the home crowd.
