Chad Ford: The ACC is full of interesting freshmen like Jahlil Okafor (ranked No. 1 on my Big Board), Justise Winslow (No. 12), Justin Jackson (No. 18) and Tyus Jones (No. 24). But we're tackling returning players in this series. Kevin and I already discussed my top-ranked returning playerÂ in the ACC, Louisville's Terry Rozier, last week. Rozier's teammate Montrezl Harrell just happens to be the second-highest-ranked returning ACC player on my board.
