LOS ANGELES -- The San Diego Padres have hired longtime Dodgers amateur scouting director Logan White to their front office, sources told ESPN on Monday. The feeling around baseball when the Dodgers hired Andrew Friedman to be their president of baseball operations was that he would want to bring in his own people in key front-office positions. With White departing, he'll have at least three top positions to fill. It is not clear which position White will fill with San Diego. In Los Angeles, Friedman has vacancies at general manager, amateur scouting director and farm director. The Dodgers' previous general manager, Ned Colletti, was reassigned to an advisory role, and farm director DeJon Watson left before Friedman's hiring to work for Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Dave Stewart. White was involved in drafting Clayton Kershaw and Matt Kemp, among others, and with the signing of Cuban defector Yasiel Puig two summers ago in Mexico, where he also found one of the Dodgers' top minor league prospects, pitcher Julio Urias. White leaves the Dodgers with three of baseball's top 20 prospects on his résumé -- Urias, outfielder Joc Pederson and infielder Corey Seager. White worked for the Padres from 1993-95 and interviewed for their vacant GM position before San Diego hired A.J. Preller from the Texas Rangers. It's unclear how much power a new GM under Friedman would wield, but it could be similar to the role most assistant GMs fill. The Dodgers have had discussions with former Arizona and San Diego GM Josh Byrnes, who was spotted at an Arizona Fall League game last week with Dodgers president Stan Kasten. The Dodgers will retain pro scouting director Rick Ragazzo as well as their pro scouts and player development staffs, a source said last week.
