The Atlanta Hawks were dealt a big blow Friday when an MRI revealed that forward Al Horford suffered a completely torn right pectoral muscle during the team's double-overtime win Thursday night at the Cleveland Cavaliers. He is out indefinitely as the Hawks and Horford research options. The two-time All-Star tweeted about the injury Friday night: Horford tore his left pectoral in 2012 and missed four months while recovering. "We will work with Al and complete our due diligence to determine the next best steps," Hawks general manger Danny Ferry said in a statement. "Injuries are part of the challenge of an NBA season." Horford left Thursday night's win in the first overtime with the injury and did not return. The Hawks said an MRI and examination on Friday by Dr. Michael Bernot in Atlanta revealed the complete tear of the muscle. Horford is one of six players in the NBA leading his team in both points (18.6) and rebounds (8.4) per game. The others are LeBron James of the Miami Heat, Kevin Love of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks, LaMarcus Aldridge of the Portland Trail Blazers and DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings. It's uncertain how the team will adjust to Horford's injury. Pero Antic, who replaced Horford Thursday night, may be the most likely candidate to move into the starting lineup. Antic has averaged 3.6 points while playing 10.5 minutes per game. Also for Atlanta, forward DeMarre Carroll is day to day with a sprained right thumb suffered against the Cavs. The Hawks have been one of the few good stories in the Eastern Conference this season. The are 16-13 and entered Friday in third place.
