The Philadelphia 76ers have released Royce White three months after acquiring him from the Houston Rockets in a trade, according to several reports. White, a first-round pick at 16th overall in 2012 who never played for the Rockets, averaged 5.0 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists in five preseason games with one start for the 76ers. Philadelphia also cut Khalif Wyatt, Vander Blue and Mac Koshwal on Thursday. The 6-foot-8 White was on the inactive list for the Rockets as he worked on an arrangement to balance his acknowledged anxiety disorder with the demands of the NBA schedule, often criticizing the team in media interviews and via Twitter.  The Rockets suspended White on Jan. 6 after he refused to accept an assignment to Rio Grande Valley in the NBDL. White tipped his cap Thursday to his Sixers teammates via Twitter.
