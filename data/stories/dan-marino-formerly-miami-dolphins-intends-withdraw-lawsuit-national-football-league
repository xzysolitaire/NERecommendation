Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino confirmed Tuesday that he is withdrawing from a concussion-related lawsuit against the NFL. Marino, 52, was one of 15 players who filed a lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia last week. The plaintiffs joined more than 4,800 others who have alleged that the NFL misled players about the long-term dangers of concussions. The league has denied those claims. "Within the last year I authorized a claim to be filed on my behalf just in case I needed future medical coverage to protect me and my family in the event I later suffered from the effects of head trauma," Marino said in a statement. "In so doing I did not realize I would be automatically listed as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the NFL. I have made the decision it is not necessary for me to be part of any claims or this lawsuit and therefore I am withdrawing as a plaintiff effective immediately. I am sympathetic to other players who are seeking relief who may have suffered head injuries. I also disclaim any references in the form complaint of current head injuries." Marino's intention to withdraw from the lawsuit was first reported by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. The lawsuit doesn't specify any medical problems suffered by the plaintiffs, including Marino, who retired in 1999. It seeks unspecified damages and medical monitoring. The NFL and the original group of players agreed on a $765 million settlement in August 2013. But the settlement was rejected by a federal judge in January.
