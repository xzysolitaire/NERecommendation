PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns have extended qualifying offers to point guard Eric Bledsoe and forward P.J. Tucker. The move was necessary by Monday for the team to retain the rights to the players, who both are restricted free agents. Both players can sign a contract with another team but the Suns have the right to match it and keep the player. The free agent period begins Tuesday.
