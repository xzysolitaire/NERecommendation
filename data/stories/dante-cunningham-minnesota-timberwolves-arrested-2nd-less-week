MEDINA, Minn. -- Police have arrested Minnesota Timberwolves forward Dante Cunningham for the second time in three days. Medina police officer Chris McGill says the 26-year-old Cunningham was arrested Sunday on preliminary charges of making terrorist threats. He declined to go into detail about the allegations but said police would release more information about the arrest on Monday. Cunningham was arrested early Thursday and charged with felony domestic assault. A criminal complaint filed in Hennepin County District Court says his girlfriend told police that during an argument at Cunningham's suburban Minneapolis home, he slammed her against the wall and choked her for 15 to 20 seconds. Police say she didn't require medical treatment. Cunningham was released from jail Friday and rejoined the team Saturday in Orlando, Fla.
