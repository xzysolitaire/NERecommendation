While the Cleveland Cavaliers try to figure out how to share the ball to maximize their offensive talent, an issue during their disappointing 1-3 start, it's easy to overlook one of the biggest questions about the Cavaliers entering this season: rim protection. Make no mistake, however: Even if Cleveland starts dominating as expected on offense, it will have to improve its defense in the paint to build the top-10 defense that has generally been required to win an NBA championshipÂ (see item 2). Through four games, the Cavaliers' defense sits in the NBA's bottom five on a per-possession basis. Cleveland also resides there in terms of field goal percentage allowed around the rim. Per NBA.com/Stats, the Cavaliers have allowed opponents to shoot 57.6 percent inside 5 feet with a defender in proximity, far worse than the league average of 52.0 percent. Tuesday's loss at Portland exposed another shaky element of Cleveland's frontcourt: defending post-ups. Per Synergy Sports, the Blazers averaged 1.29 points per play on shots, turnovers or trips to the free throw line created out of the post. And while that number was inflated by shooting guard Wesley Matthews posting up smaller perimeter defenders, Portland scored 14 points out of 12 post-ups against big men Kevin Love (who struggled to contest shots) and Tristan Thompson (who struggled to maintain position).
