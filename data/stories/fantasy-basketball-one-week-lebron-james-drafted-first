If you could redraft your fantasy basketball team now, more than a week into the NBA's regular season, what would you do differently? Would you still take LeBron James with the No. 1 pick? Or would King James' early-season struggles steer you towardÂ Anthony Davis, Stephen Curry or James Harden? Obviously, you wouldn't draft Russell Westbrook in the first round, knowing that he's out for the month of November due to a broken finger, and you'd probably shy away from Derrick Rose, knowing that his ankles are already giving him problems. But what about guys like Lance Stephenson, Mike Conley and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- players who have under-produced even while healthy? On the flip side, which players would you go out of your way to draft much higher than you would have only a few weeks ago in your real draft? These are some of the questions I've been asking myself in recent days, and on Monday our own Brian McKitish did an excellent job of shedding some light on this by providing a list of rising and falling players. Now, I'd like to take it a step further and examine two aspects in closer detail: 1) Whether our changed perceptions of certain players based off of one week's worth of games are valid or complete knee-jerk reactions and a matter of small sample size getting the best of us; and 2) where the high-profile risers and fallers would be picked now. To find out, I reached out to ESPN Insider Kevin Pelton for his statistical perspective, talked to fellow ESPN fantasy basketball expert Jim McCormick and even polled the @ESPNNBA and @ESPNFantasy Twitter followers for their feedback. Here's what I was able to gather, starting at the top with the man who was supposed to fix all of the problems in Cleveland. Trending down
