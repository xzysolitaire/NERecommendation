HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. -- Michael Jordan's 56,000-square-foot home in suburban Chicago has failed to sell at auction after the bidding fell short. Jordan spokeswoman Estee Portnoy says nobody offered the reserve price of $13 million for the 7-acre estate in Highland Park, north of Chicago. Portnoy says Concierge Auctions publicized Monday's auction well but that market conditions aren't ideal. She says options for the property will be evaluated next year. The former Chicago Bulls superstar's home originally was listed at $29 million in early 2012. It has nine bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, a pool pavilion and a regulation-size indoor basketball court. It also features what is described as a "gentleman's retreat," complete with a library, wet bar and the original doors from the Playboy mansion in Chicago. Jordan now owns the Charlotte Bobcats.
