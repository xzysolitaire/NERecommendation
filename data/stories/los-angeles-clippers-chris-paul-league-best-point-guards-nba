Tom Penn: Well, the 2014-15 season is starting tonight. We've seen the evolution of the point guard and its importance in the league over the past decade. So guys, who is the best point guard in the NBA? George Karl: I'm tired of not giving Tony Parker any credit. Parker over the past three or four years has been the best point guard in the NBA. Now, is he the most talented point guard? No. Does he put the best numbers up? No. But consider what he does for his team -- a team that has been dominating. If you take the Spurs' record and take what they have done, the only thing they failed in is they should have won two or three championships. He's their motor, their energy, their delivery.
