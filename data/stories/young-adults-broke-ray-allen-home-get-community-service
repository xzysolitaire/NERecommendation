MIAMI -- Six young adults who broke into the home of former Miami Heat star Ray Allen have been sentenced to community service and ordered to make a charitable contribution. Under an agreement with prosecutors Friday that avoids possible jail time for trespassing, each of the six will do 100 hours of community service at a homeless shelter. They also must contribute $1,000 each to a foundation started by former Heat player Shane Battier to help people who are poor afford college. Police say the group was attending a party Aug. 14 near Allen's home when they decided go inside because it appeared unoccupied and they were curious. But Allen's wife and her four children were asleep in the home. Police say the group fled when she awoke and yelled at them.
