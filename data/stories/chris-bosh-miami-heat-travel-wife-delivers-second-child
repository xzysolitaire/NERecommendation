MIAMI -- The Miami Heat will be without Chris Bosh for Tuesday's game against Toronto after the starting center remained in Miami to be with his wife for the birth of their second child. Bosh was not available for the Heat's practice Monday and did not travel with the team for its afternoon flight to Toronto. Bosh's wife, Adrienne, delivered baby girl Dylan Bosh at 5:55 a.m. Monday morning and the couple posted photos of the newborn on social media. Bosh spent the first seven seasons of his career with the Raptors before leaving as a free agent in the summer of 2010 to join LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami. Bosh, an 11-year veteran with eight All-Star appearances, had his best game of the season with 24 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in Sunday's 103-93 home victory against the Washington Wizards. Because it's a one-game trip to Toronto, it's likely Bosh will be back in the lineup when the Heat return home for Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Heat could start Chris Andersen or Joel Anthony at center Tuesday against the Raptors.
