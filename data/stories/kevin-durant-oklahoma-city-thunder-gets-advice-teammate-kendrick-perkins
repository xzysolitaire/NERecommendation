Kevin Durant, who has led the league in scoring in four of the past five seasons, won his first league MVP this season and carried the Oklahoma City Thunder when fellow star Russell Westbrook recovered from a knee injury. But teammate Kendrick Perkins still thinks there's more Durant can do: spend time in the weight room. "I feel like he could get stronger, in my opinion," Perkins told The Oklahoman. "I think that would help him a lot. I told him all the good and great players that played the game, from Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, they all put size on them, and it helped them." Perkins believes the added strength will help Durant defend consistently and make him a more dependable threat in the low post, even while playing a league high in minutes. "Seems like there was possessions he was tired," Perkins said, according to the paper. "But, like I said, I think that's [when] getting in the weight room plays a factor. Cause then you could let your body take over." Durant, for his part, says he can "always be better" when it comes to helping the Thunder chase a championship. Oklahoma City lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in six games in the Western Conference finals.
