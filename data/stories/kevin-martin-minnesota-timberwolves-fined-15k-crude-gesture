MINNEAPOLIS -- The NBA has fined Minnesota Timberwolves guard Kevin Martin $15,000 for what the league called an "obscene gesture" during the fourth quarter against the Chicago Bulls. The league announced the fine Monday. The gesture came after Martin hit a 3-pointer with just over 90 seconds to play in the game Saturday night. As he headed back to the other end of the court, Martin cupped his hands and held them just below his waist. The dance move was popularized by former Timberwolves guard Sam Cassell, who used to do it after big shots until the NBA started issuing fines to curb it. Martin had 33 points in the game, but the Wolves lost 106-105 on two free throws by Jimmy Butler with 0.2 seconds left.
