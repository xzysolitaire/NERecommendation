While the height and weight measurements from the NBA draft combine are interesting and relevant, general managers and scouts also spend a lot of time dissecting the results of the athletic testing.

Players are asked to test their vertical jump two ways (no step and maximum) and run several drills to measure speed and lateral quickness. Oklahoma State's Markel Brown and Arizona State's Jahii Carson recorded the biggest maximum vertical with a whopping 43.5 inches. Those are some of the highest scores ever recorded in the draft combine. To read Chad Ford's full story on the most impressive players at the NBA draft combine, sign up for Insider today.
