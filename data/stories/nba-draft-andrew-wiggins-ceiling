Denny Medley/USA TODAY SportsKansas freshman Andrew Wiggins is averaging 17.4 points and 6 rebounds per game this season. ESPN Insider's Chad Ford and Kevin Pelton return to provide the kind of discussions that are happening in front offices around the NBA -- where scouts and statistical experts are breaking down NBA draft prospects using their "eyes, ears and numbers." Chad Ford's Top 100 | Big Board 7.0 | Mock Draft 3.0 Is Wiggins still the NBA draft's top prospect? Chad Ford: Andrew Wiggins began the college season as the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft among NBA scouts and general managers. After an up-and-down start to his college career at Kansas, it looks like he'll end the season exactly where he began -- No. 1 on our Big Board. Kevin Pelton: Wiggins isn't quite so high on my statistical draft board. While he's climbed in the past month, and could continue to rise with a strong NCAA tournament run, Wiggins' WARP projection (1.5 WARP per year) ranks him in the 20s. When the actual draft class takes shape, I expect he'll be somewhere in the early 10s -- not exactly a red flag, certainly, but also not the kind of dominant numbers we expected from a player touted as a generational prospect.
