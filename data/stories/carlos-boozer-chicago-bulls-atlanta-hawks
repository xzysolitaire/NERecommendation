CHICAGO -- Carlos Boozer did not play on Saturday night against the Atlanta Hawks because of a sore knee. Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau does not believe the injury will linger. "I don't think so," he said before the game. "It's a little better today. We'll see where he is [Sunday]." Thibodeau said the injury occurred during Thursday's win over the Boston Celtics. Boozer underwent an MRI, the results of which came back negative. "We're hopeful that it's not anything serious," Thibodeau said. After missing 23 games in his first season with the Bulls, Boozer has been the healthiest starter the team has had under Thibodeau. He has missed just two games the past two years. "He never misses practice," Thibodeau said. "Never misses games really. So it's been a big plus."
