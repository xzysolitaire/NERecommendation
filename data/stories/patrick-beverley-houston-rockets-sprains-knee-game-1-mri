Houston Rockets point guard Patrick Beverley, who is four games into a comeback from a torn meniscus in his right knee, sprained the same knee in Game 1's 122-120 overtime loss to the Portland Trail Blazers and will have an MRI on Monday, the team announced after the game. He consulted with Dr. James Andrews after the tear, which came in a March 27 game against Philadelphia, and was told the tear did not require surgery, sources close to the situation told ESPN.com's Marc Stein. Beverley missed eight games. He appeared to injure himself Sunday when LaMarcus Aldridge, who scored a franchise playoff-record 46 points, knocked Beverley to the floor while setting a pick with 1:04 left in overtime. An emotional Aldridge continued to yell at the referees even after he went to the bench. "All of us are saddened by the fact that Pat hurt his knee again," Dwight Howard said, according to the Houston Chronicle. "I didn't want to see anything happen to him. ... It hurts all of us. We just have to step up here as a team and win it for him." The second-year guard had nine points and six rebounds in Sunday's loss.
