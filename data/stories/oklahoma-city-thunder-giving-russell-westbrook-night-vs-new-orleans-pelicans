NEW ORLEANS -- Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks says he's sitting Russell Westbrook out of Monday night's game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Brooks says the decision is meant to provide his star point guard with extra rest after the playoff-bound Thunder played in Indianapolis on Sunday. Reggie Jackson is slated to start in Westbrook's place. Pelicans guard Tyreke Evans, who did not play Saturday night in Houston because of a right knee bruise, is scheduled to be in the starting lineup when New Orleans tries to snap an eight-game skid against the Thunder. Pelicans coach Monty Williams says he does not expect point guard Brian Roberts to play. Roberts also missed Saturday's game with a sore left ankle.
