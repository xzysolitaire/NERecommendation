Hey, remember when Vince Carter jumped over poor Frederic Weis in the 2000 Olympics? "Le dunk de la mort?" That dunk will be replayed until the end of recorded time, because it was perfect -- one of the most exciting players in basketball doing something unprecedented on a world stage. Vince Carter is 37 now, and he'll likely never do anything like that again, but he's still got some ups. That's not a very nice thing to do to a former teammate, but considering that Nowitzki went to the bench laughing, we have no doubt he's happy for Carter. Sometimes you just have to give the other guy credit.
