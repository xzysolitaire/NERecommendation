LOS ANGELES -- Retired NBA star Robert Horry wasn't hurt after a car he was driving hit a motorcycle on a Los Angeles freeway and left the rider hospitalized. The California Highway Patrol said Wednesday that Horry's 2014 Infiniti collided with a 2013 Yamaha motorcycle driven by Xerxes Baldonasa of Long Beach on Tuesday afternoon on the 105 Freeway near Inglewood. According to the CHP, the 44-year-old Baldonasa was treated for moderate injuries at a hospital. The 43-year-old Horry wasn't hurt. Neither man was arrested. The CHP says Baldonasa was riding between two sets of double yellow lines that separate the car pool lane from other lanes. Horry was attempting to change from the left lane into the car pool lane, and crossed over the double yellow lines, which caused him to hit the motorcycle. The accident remains under investigation. Horry played for the Lakers from 1997 to 2003, and was known for making clutch shots in big games. He won seven NBA championships with the Lakers, Houston, and San Antonio. He also played for Phoenix during his 16-year pro career, which ended in 2008. Horry is a TV analyst for Time Warner Cable SportsNet, which carries the Lakers' games.
