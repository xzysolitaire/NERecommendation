NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets center Brook Lopez will not play in Friday night's game against the Detroit Pistons, the team announced. Reggie Evans will start in his place. Lopez resprained his left ankle in the third quarter of Thursday night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. He returned briefly before trainer Tim Walsh decided Lopez's night was finished for good. Lopez missed seven games earlier in the season after originally suffering the injury in Phoenix on Nov. 15. Lopez, 25, is averaging 20.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game. He ranks third in the NBA in player efficiency rating behind only the Miami Heat's LeBron James and the New Orleans Pelicans' Anthony Davis. Forward Andrei Kirilenko (back) and guard Jason Terry (knee) remained out for the Nets. The team said both players are progressing in their rehabs and are targeting a return in one to two weeks. Paul Pierce was set to come off the bench against the Pistons for the third consecutive game. Alan Anderson remained the starter at small forward.
