SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs point guard Tony Parker sat out the team's 113-91 win Monday night over the Philadelphia 76ers with a sore left Achilles. Parker had 20 points, five assists and five rebounds while playing 28 minutes Saturday in a victory over Golden State. Parker was not listed on the pregame injury report Monday, but was ruled out about 45 minutes before tip-off against Philadelphia and former San Antonio assistant Brett Brown. Parker leads the Spurs in both scoring (17.6 points) and assists (6.1) while also averaging the most minutes with 30.3. San Antonio was also without forward Matt Bonner, who has a strained right calf. The Spurs have won 13 straight while the 76ers have lost 24 in a row. Philadelphia is two losses shy of tying the NBA record for most consecutive losses, set by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010-2011. Describing Brown as "one of my best friends," Popovich said the 76ers coach is tough enough to weather the storm of such a dubious record. "I feel terribly for him, but I don't feel sorry for him," Popovich said. "I feel badly for him because he has to go through it, but I don't need to feel sorry for him. He would be angry if he knew I felt sorry for him because he doesn't want anyone to feel sorry for him."
