The Texas Rangers interviewed pitching coach Mike Maddux and Triple-A manager Steve Buechele for their managerial job on Tuesday. The Rangers are trying to find a replacement for Ron Washington, who resigned on Sept. 5. Washington was replaced by Tim Bogar,Â who went 14-8. Maddux has been with the Rangers for the last six seasons and his contract ends at the end of October. He has never been a manager at any level. With several other jobs available such as Arizona and Minnesota, Maddux has said he's open to looking for a managerial position elsewhere, though he expressed his desire to remain with the Rangers. Buechele has spent six seasons in the Rangers organization as a manager in their farm system. In his first season with Triple-A Round Rock, the Express finished last in the Pacific Coast League American Southern Division at 70-74. Buechele, like Maddux a former big-league player, had four consecutive winning seasons at Double-A Frisco before leaving to take the Triple-A job for the 2014 season. The Houston Astros conducted a phone interview with Buechele last week. Rangers GM Jon Daniels said he will interview some external candidates in addition to Bogar, who has yet to interview for the job, in the next few weeks. Daniels said he would like to hire a manager by the end of October.
