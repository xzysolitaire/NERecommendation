Insider offers a breakdown of every playoff series using an expert combination of scouting from Amin Elhassan and advanced metrics from Bradford Doolittle to answer three crucial questions.

It's a rematch of the 2012 Western Conference finals, and wouldn't you know it, the basketball gods have made a house call to the Oklahoma City Thunder again. After overcoming the straitjacket defense of Memphis in the first round and receiving a tiny bit of luck to defeat the Clippers in the conference semifinals, the injury bug has claimed a key member from the Thunder's roster for the second straight postseason. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had their own scare in the first round against a pesky Dallas team, but eventually righted the ship and crushed Portland in the conference semifinals. In the process, Tony Parker suffered a strained hamstring, but he's expected to play through it. Can the Thunder fulfill their destiny as the next great NBA team, or will the Spurs take one step closer to avenging the sins of last season?
