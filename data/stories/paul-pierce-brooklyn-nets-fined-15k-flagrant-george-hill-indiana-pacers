EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Brooklyn Nets small forward Paul Pierce was fined $15,000 for "making excessive and unnecessary contact" with Indiana Pacers point guard George Hill in the third quarter of Monday night's game, the NBA announced Tuesday. Pierce was issued a flagrant foul 2 with 4:22 left in the third quarter Monday night after he clotheslined Hill as the Pacers guard was about to go up for a layup in transition. Power's flagrant foul 2 earned him an automatic ejection. Pierce (0-for-7) was held scoreless for the first time since March 9, 1999 -- the 16th game of his 16-year career. The Nets (9-18) lost to the Pacers 103-86 at the Barclays Center. Pierce has not spoken to the media since the incident.
