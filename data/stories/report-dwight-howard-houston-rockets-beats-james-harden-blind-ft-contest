Dwight Howard's struggles at the free throw line are well known. Turns out the problem may be his eyes -- and the fact he's using them. Howard challenged Houston Rockets teammate and 84.2 percent free throw shooter James Harden to a free throw contest where both had to shoot 10 with their eyes closed. Howard came out on top by sinking eight shots, according to a report by the Houston Chronicle. "I might have to start [shooting with] my eyes closed in games," Howard said, according to the Chronicle. "I have a good percentage. I am 8 for 10 with my eyes closed." In his career, Howard has shot 49.2 percent from the free throw line but has said he has hopes of shooting at least 75 percent this season. Howard, who signed with Houston as a free agent this offseason, said he's been working on his foul line foibles and had practiced shooting with his eyes closed. "There is a guy who has the world record for most free throws made and he told me to do that drill and it's good for trusting your form," Howard said, according to the Chronicle. "You can't see nothing, so you have to trust your form and trust that it goes in."
