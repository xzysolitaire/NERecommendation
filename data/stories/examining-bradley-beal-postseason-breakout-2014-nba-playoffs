Brad Mills/USA TODAY SportsBradley Beal is averaging 20.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game in the 2014 playoffs. The NBA playoffs provide an opportunity for the league's up-and-coming stars to introduce themselves to a national audience. With apologies to Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Wizards point guard John Wall, both already All-Stars, this season's breakthrough player looks like Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Beal's sparkling Game 1 effort on Monday in the Wizards' win at Indiana (25 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, 5 steals) was his third 25-point game in his first six postseason contests, putting him alongside Magic Johnson as the two players to reach that mark three times before age 21.
