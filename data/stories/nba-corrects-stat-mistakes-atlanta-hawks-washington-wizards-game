WASHINGTON -- The NBA has changed several numbers after a rough night for the stats crew at the game between the Atlanta Hawks and Washington Wizards. It turns out Wizards guard Bradley Beal didn't commit a career-high seven turnovers; he had only five. Teammate John Wall had seven instead of six. And the Wizards had 20 giveaways instead of 25. Inaccurate numbers were released throughout Tuesday night's game, a 106-102 win for the Hawks. "Final" stats also contained inaccuracies. Among other changes made Wednesday: Atlanta's Kyle Korver went 0 of 4 from the field, not 0 for 3. And Washington's Paul Pierce was 6 for 16, not 6 for 14.
