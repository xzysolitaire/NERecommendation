SALT LAKE CITY -- The Utah Jazz have acquired veteran forward Steve Novak from Toronto in exchange for guard Diante Garrett. The Jazz also received the rights to New York's second-round draft pick in 2017 as part of the deal, which was formally announced on Thursday. The 6-foot-10 Novak has a .432 3-point percentage over his eight-year career, second only to Golden State's Stephen Curry (.440) among active players. Novak has averaged 5 points and 1.4 rebounds in 13 minutes over 414 career games, playing with Houston, the Clippers, Dallas, San Antonio, New York and Chicago. Garrett, a call-up from the NBA D-League last November, averaged 14.8 minutes, with 3.5 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 71 Jazz games.
