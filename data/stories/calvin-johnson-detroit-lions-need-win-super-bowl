The Detroit Lions have been a stranger to success, but some members of the 2014 version are bullish on their chances this season, including the team's best player. Wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who discussed with NFL Network his No. 2 ranking on the network's Top 100 players list this week, said the Lions feel they have what it takes to win a Super Bowl. "We need to win a Super Bowl," Johnson said Wednesday. "That's the No. 1 thing. That's the No. 1 thing [and] should be for every team going into the beginning of the year. "We're definitely in a place where we feel we could do that." Earlier this offseason, new Lions safety James Ihedigbo said he believed the team has a "championship DNA," a thought that defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh recently agreed with. The Detroit Lions haven't won their division since 1993 and have played in just two playoff games since 2000. The team finished 7-9 in 2013. Johnson credited new coach Jim Caldwell for the team's optimism heading into this season. "It's an overall change and vibe here, and we love it," Johnson told NFL Network. "We're going to go out and bust our butts every day because Jim is such a great guy, a great leader for our team. And he's helped bring us together, and we're doing a lot of stuff on our own off the field to keep that camaraderie going."
