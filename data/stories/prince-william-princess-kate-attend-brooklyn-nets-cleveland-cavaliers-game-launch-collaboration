It looks as though the Dec. 8 game between the Nets and Cavaliers at Barclays Center in Brooklyn will have some royal flair. And we're not just talking about King James. Prince William and Princess Kate, who will be in the United States from Dec. 7-9, plan to attend the game, according to a news release issued by the British government. "On Monday evening, Their Royal Highnesses will attend an NBA basketball game to help launch a new collaboration between the Royal Foundation, United for Wildlife and the NBA," the release states. The couple will be in New York City at the time, the first visit to the city for both. They also will visit the Sept. 11 memorial. It is the couple's first official visit to the country since spending time in California in 2011. Maybe the biggest cheers of the night won't be reserved for LeBron James or Deron Williams, after all.
