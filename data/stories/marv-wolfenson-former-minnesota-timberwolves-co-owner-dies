Timberwolves spokesman Brad Ruiter told The Associated Press on Saturday that Wolfenson died in La Jolla, Calif. Ruiter did not know any other details. Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were the Timberwolves' original owners when the NBA granted them and Minnesota an expansion franchise that began play in 1989. They also owned a series of Twin Cities health clubs. They were responsible for building Target Center. They sold the team to Mankato businessman Glen Taylor in 1994. Ratner died in 2006.
