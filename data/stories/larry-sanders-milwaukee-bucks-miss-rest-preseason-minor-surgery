MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee Bucks center Larry Sanders will miss the rest of the preseason after minor surgery. General manager John Hammond said Friday that Sanders had an outpatient procedure. Sanders is expected to be ready when the regular season begins Oct. 29 against the Charlotte Hornets. Details of Sanders' surgery were not disclosed. The Bucks had already announced that Sanders would miss Friday night's preseason game in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, against Minnesota because of an illness. Sanders played well in three preseason games, averaging 10.7 points and 10.0 rebounds. The 6-foot-11 shot-blocking center hopes to bounce back from a season marred by an orbital bone fracture and a thumb injury. Sanders also had off-court issues after signing a four-year, $44 million contract extension.
