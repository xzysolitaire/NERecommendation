At the start of the 1985-86 NBA season, you might recall Michael Jordan suffering a foot fracture that sidelined him for nearly 4Â½ months. Understand Jordan's injury was to the navicular bone, which is a more rare and worrisome injury (it ended Yao Ming's career in Houston and is what likely will sideline Sixers 2014 first-round pick Joel Embiid for an entire season) than the "Jones fracture" sustained by Kevin Durant. Most of the reporting maintains Durant should be cleared to play in about six to eight weeks, though Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti has offered no exact timetable. However, a sustained absence like Jordan's appears unlikely.
