Consider this: Earlier this week, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst reported that the 11-21 Cleveland Cavaliers are considering trading for 33-year-old Pau Gasol. And nobody batted an eye. Such is life in this year's Eastern Conference, where winning a third of your games leaves a team within striking distance of the playoffs. How good might the Cavaliers be with Gasol?
