NBA's back-to-back problem | Fixing NBA's unhealthy schedule | Worst 4-in-5s On an early Sunday morning in late December last season, the Houston Rockets flew to Oklahoma City for a tilt against the Thunder. It was a tough matchup for Houston, but there was reason for the Rockets to feel some good vibes. The squad led by James Harden and Dwight Howard were riding a three-game winning streak. The Rockets had a relatively clean bill of health and Oklahoma City would be without star point guard Russell Westbrook, who succumbed to another serious knee injury just four days prior. But then they took the court. The Rockets got trampled by the Westbrook-less Thunder 117-86. This was a bloodbath. Harden and Howard both played perhaps their worst games in a Houston uniform, shooting 2-for-9 and 4-for-13, respectively. Both sat the bench for the entire fourth quarter. Why did the Rockets suddenly fall apart? The answer, as sports scientists and sleep doctors will tell you, may be found in the schedule.
