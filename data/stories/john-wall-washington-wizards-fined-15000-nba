NEW YORK -- Washington Wizards guard John Wall was fined $15,000 by the NBA on Thursday for inappropriate comments toward game officials. Wall made the remarks on the court after the Wizards' 98-85 home loss to the Charlotte Bobcats on Wednesday night. Wall had plenty to say about the officiating. He was particularly upset that was called for fouling Kemba Walker during Walker's 3-point attempt in the fourth quarter. "I ain't touch him. All he did is scream," Wall said. "Ref gave him a call all night because he was screaming. ... I think they made some unfortunate calls plenty of times." Wall also said: "Plenty of times I drove to the basket. I think I should have been to the line plenty more."
