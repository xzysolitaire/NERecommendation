DENVER -- Jack Elway, the son ofÂ Broncos general manager John Elway, was arrested on assault charges after his girlfriend told police he pulled her out of a car by her hair. Court documents obtained Monday show the woman told Denver police that 24-year-old John Albert Elway also pushed her to the ground when she tried to get back in the car, causing scrapes. The documents say the incident happened early Saturday near a college campus in downtown Denver. Elway initially fled the scene. Elway was released from jail on $550 bond and was scheduled to appear in court Thursday. He faces charges of assault and disturbing the peace. Court records do not list an attorney. A Broncos spokesman says the case is a personal family matter.
