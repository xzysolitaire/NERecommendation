The Brooklyn Nets will play two preseason games against the Sacramento Kings in China next season. The Nets will face the Kings on Oct. 12 in Shanghai and on Oct. 15 in Beijing as part of the NBA Global Games 2014. The Nets played two preseason games in China four years ago. "It's an honor for us to represent Brooklyn and the League in China," Nets coach Jason Kidd said in a statement. "The borough and the Nets have connections to fans all over the world and it's a great opportunity to play on a major international stage in China." Ever since Mikhail Prokhorov took ownership of the Nets in May 2010, the franchise has taken seemingly every opportunity to improve its global brand. The Nets have played in London on three different occasions: a preseason game in 2008, two regular-season games against the Toronto Raptors in 2011 and a regular-season game against the Atlanta Hawks last January. There will also be other NBA preseason games overseas. The San Antonio Spurs will play two Euroleague Basketball teams. San Antonio faces eight-time German champion Alba Berlin in Berlin on Oct. 8 and five-time Turkish champ Fenerbahce Ulker Istanbul in Istanbul on Oct. 11. The Cavaliers will face the Heat on Oct. 11 in Rio de Janeiro. The NBA will later announce regular-season international games for 2014-15 as part of its efforts to promote the league around the world.
