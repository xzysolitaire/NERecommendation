Belinelli provided the already-deep Spurs with a reasonable facsimile to Manu Ginobili, and ended up second on the Spurs in minutes played during the regular season. Further, it was the efficiency of players such as Belinelli, Patty Mills and Boris Diaw that allowed the Spurs to keep their foundation players under 30 minutes per game, preserving the veterans' best performance for San Antonio's title run. Likewise, Washington's midseason acquisition of Andre Miller last season helped to solidify the Wizards' rotation. Miller played more than 20 minutes in a game just twice, but the Wizards went 18-10 with Miller, and knocked out Chicago in the first round of the playoffs.  So which relatively unheralded moves from the 2014 offseason will prove significant this season?
