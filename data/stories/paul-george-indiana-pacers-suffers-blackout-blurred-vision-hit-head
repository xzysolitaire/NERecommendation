Indiana Pacers swingman Paul George said he briefly blacked out and then had blurred vision for the final four or five minutes of Indiana's Game 2 loss after he took a hit to the head from Dwyane Wade's knee. George remained in the game for the duration of the Miami Heat's 87-83 win over the Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday night and finished with 14 points. Coach Frank Vogel said that trainers checked George out after the collision, and he was told George was good to go. George and Wade collided while chasing a loose ball, and both came up grimacing. Wade held his left knee. George also grabbed at his knee, then said in his postgame news conference that he had blacked out and suffered blurred vision. "The trainers will look at it and see what [symptoms] are going to be from that," George said. "We're just going to go day-to-day with it, I guess." The Pacers say George will continue to be evaluated over the next several days. If George suffered a concussion, he will be subject to the league's concussion protocol and must be symptom-free for 24 hours before being cleared to play. Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Saturday in Miami. The series is tied at one game apiece.
