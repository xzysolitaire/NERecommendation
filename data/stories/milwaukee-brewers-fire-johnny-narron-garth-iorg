MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Brewers have fired hitting coach Johnny Narron and first base-infield coach Garth Iorg after the team's late-season collapse. But the team said Friday that manager Ron Roenicke and the rest of the coaching staff will return next season. General manager Doug Melvin says after evaluating the work of Roenicke and the coaches, "this is the best course of action to take." Narron was hitting coach for three seasons. Iorg served four seasons as first base coach. Returning for the 2015 season will be coach Mike Guerrero, pitching coach Rick Kranitz, bench coach Jerry Narron, third base coach Ed Sedar, outfield coach John Shelby and bullpen coach Lee Tunnell. The Brewers went 9-22 down the stretch and missed the playoffs for the third straight year.
