Brooklyn Nets center Brook Lopez, who has been rehabbing after undergoing foot and ankle surgery, told reporters in Russia that he has been "fully cleared for play." "I was fully cleared for play and everything about a week and a half ago now," said Lopez, who is visiting the country with his twin brother, Portland Trail Blazers center Robin Lopez. "... Now it's time to get back in shape." Lopez, 26, suffered a season-ending right foot injury on Dec. 20 in Philadelphia. He underwent surgery to repair the fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot on Jan. 4. He also underwent a second procedure, called a first metatarsal osteotomy, in which another bone was repositioned in his foot to unload and protect the injured area. Then, on March 3, Lopez had surgery to repair a torn tendon and tighten lateral ligaments in his left ankle. He had been doing some shooting and workout drills prior to being fully cleared. It's unknown how the Nets will handle Lopez this coming season given his history of foot problems. If he is healthy, Lopez can be a dominant offensive weapon in the low post. Before getting injured last season, he was averaging a career-high 20.7 points a game on 56.3 percent shooting.
