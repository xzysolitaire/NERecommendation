LOS ANGELES -- Lakers center Pau Gasol plans to undergo an MRI on his sprained right ankle, the big man said after the Lakers' 114-108 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. The Lakers have a scheduled off day Monday with their next game not coming until Friday in Sacramento but Gasol said he will use the free day to have his ankle examined. Gasol, who sat out the Lakers' practice on Saturday to rest the ankle, called the injury "a little sore" after the game. He struggled mightily against the Blazers, finishing with six points on 3-for-15 shooting and a season-low five rebounds in 25 minutes. "I just missed some wide-open shots," Gasol said. "I missed them early, I missed them late." The 13-year veteran did not play in the fourth quarter as Robert Sacre filled in at center with L.A.'s bench unit that cut Portland's 20-point lead all the way down to one before losing by six. "Robert was playing really well and the unit that was out there was pretty well and we know that Mike [D'Antoni] likes to stick with units that are functioning and making runs," Gasol said. "I wasn't upset because we were making a big run and I wasn't having a particularly good night." Gasol is also dealing with a sprained pinkie finger on his left hand. "My hand is a little jammed up too, but nothing bone [related]," Gasol said. "Nothing major."
