Welcome to #NBAfrontofficerank, our first #NBArank for management. We're starting today with the overall rankings, which will be unveiled here and on Twitter, using the hashtag #NBAfrontofficerank, starting at 11 a.m. ET. Then we'll break out the three categories -- owners, team presidents/general managers and coaches -- from Wednesday to Friday. We asked our ESPN Forecast panel to rate every owner, basketball decision-maker and coach from 0 to 10, and we asked the panel to tell us how important each role is. In particular, we asked the voters to rate each team's front-office management on its guidance and leadership in terms of how it affects overall on-court success, both in the short and long term. From there, we simply calculated the ratings to determine the best and worst front offices in the NBA. Here's what we found. Front-Office Rankings: Owners | Top executives | Coaches
