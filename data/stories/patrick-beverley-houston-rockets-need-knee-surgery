Houston Rockets guard Patrick Beverley was informed Monday by knee specialist Dr. James Andrews that he will not require surgery on his damaged right knee, sources close to the situation confirmed. Beverley was confident that would be the case when he spoke with local reporters Saturday night, saying he would "for sure" return this season despite suffering a suspected torn meniscus earlier in the week. On Monday afternoon, Beverley tweeted about his good news. But even after Andrews confirmed Monday that Beverley would not need surgery, it's believed that the backcourt defensive specialist will be out up to two more weeks to fully recover. Rockets center Dwight Howard is also out at least another week with an ankle injury.
