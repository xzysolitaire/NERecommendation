For a team like the Golden State Warriors that's built around "The Splash Brothers," Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the Warriors didn't exactly make a huge splash in free agency over the offseason. Other than the signing of backup point guard Shaun Livingston to a three-year, $16 million deal, the Warriors' roster you see today is essentially the same as a season ago. But make no mistake -- the Warriors made a splash over the summer. It came May 15, the day they signed Steve Kerr to a five-year deal to take over as coach. Kerr inherited a talented, playoff-caliber roster that was accustomed to relying on players like Curry and Thompson to create their own shots, often times early in the shot clock, under former coach Mark Jackson. In fact, the Warriors averaged just 2.47 passes per possession last season, the fewest in the NBA and nearly a full pass less than teams like San Antonio and Chicago. Kerr's new offensive system has changed all that overnight, putting an emphasis on sharing the basketball and working deeper into the shot clock. "There's more passing, which creates some easier shots," said ESPN's Ethan Sherwood Strauss, who covers the Warriors' home games. "Jackson liked to leverage size advantages into isolation post ups. This strategy created a lot of tough, low efficiency shots for players like Thompson. Under Kerr, Thompson is driving more to the basket and taking better shots in general." It's no accident that Thompson is on pace to shatter his previous career-highs in a number of important statistical categories.
