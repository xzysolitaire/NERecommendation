LAS VEGAS -- The Indiana Pacers have agreed to terms with free agent guard Rodney Stuckey on a one-year deal, according to multiple reports. ESPN's Marc Stein first reported the Pacers' interest in Stuckey to replace Lance Stephenson, who signed with the Charlotte Hornets. Stuckey and the Pacers came to the agreement on Wednesday, one day after the Hornets swooped in to land Stephenson. Terms of the deal, which was first reported by USA Today, were not immediately available.  Stuckey averaged 13.9 points last season, his seventh with the Detroit Pistons. With Stephenson gone, Indiana was in desperate need for some offensive help. The Pacers also brought in veteran C.J. Miles to add some shooting earlier this month. Stephenson was one of the Pacers' best offensive players on a team that often struggled to put the ball in the basket. He gained All-Star consideration while averaging 13.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists in a breakout year. But he also showed flashes of erratic behavior, most notably when he blew into LeBron James' ear during the Eastern Conference finals. Charlotte landed him with a three-year, $27 million contract after the Pacers couldn't close the deal with him, so Indiana moved quickly to address the loss. Stuckey was once viewed as a promising building block for the Pistons, and he averaged 16.6 points and 4.8 assists in 2009-10. Stuckey only shot 27 percent from 3-point range and just over 43 percent from the field overall, so he won't bring a lot of perimeter shooting help to Indiana.  The Pistons had little use for Stuckey after they brought in D.J. Augustin and Jodie Meeks to add to their backcourt. They also added forward Caron Butler, who can bring some 3-point shooting to the team.
