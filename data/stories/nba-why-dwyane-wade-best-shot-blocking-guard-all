Wade Joins 700 Block Club As Dwyane Wade joins the 700 block club, Tom Haberstroh takes us through guard's tall list of victims.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte Hornets guard Lance Stephenson drove baseline past Wade and rose for a high-flying dunk in the fourth quarter. It didn't work out as planned. Wade came up from behind and swatted the ball cleanly, sending it into the front row. And with that, Wade became the first 6-foot-4 (or shorter) player ever to break the 700-block barrier. To put it in perspective, the next-tallest player listed 6-4 or under on the active list is Tony Allen at 257 blocks, followed by Kirk Hinrich (227) and Andre Miller (221). Those three combined? 705. Just about Wade's total all by himself.   To read more about Dwyane Wade's unmatched shot-blocking ability and whom he has swatted the most, become an ESPN Insider today.
