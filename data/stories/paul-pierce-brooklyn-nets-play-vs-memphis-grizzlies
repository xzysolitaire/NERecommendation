Brooklyn Nets forward Paul Pierce will not play Saturday against the Memphis Grizzlies due to a bruised right hand, the team announced. Pierce, who had been listed as doubtful, is shooting just 31.1 percent in his last 11 games, including 23.8 percent from 3-point range. The 36-year-old Pierce was one of four Brooklyn starters benched by coach Jason Kidd for the entire second half of Friday's 114-95 blowout loss to the Houston Rockets. Alan Anderson will start Saturday in place of Pierce. Joining Anderson in Saturday night's starting lineup will be center Brook Lopez, power forward Kevin Garnett, shooting guard Joe Johnson and point guard Tyshawn Taylor. Lopez returned to the lineup Friday following a seven-game absence due to a sprained left ankle and scored 16 points in 21 minutes. Kidd answered "we'll see" when asked about Lopez's minutes Saturday, according to the New York Post. Garnett (rest) did not play Friday night. Taylor, coming off a 16-point, 12-assist performance Friday, will make his first career start.
