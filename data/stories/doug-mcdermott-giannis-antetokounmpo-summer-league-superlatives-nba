Wednesday was the midpoint of the 11-day schedule for the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, making this a good time to look back at the best (and sometimes worst) of the action we've seen on the UNLV campus over the past six days. Here are my picks for the top players, best skills and highest entertainment value during the summer league. Best rookies 1. Doug McDermott | Chicago Bulls The best player in college basketball last season also has been the best rookie in Vegas thus far. McDermott has handled the transition to the perimeter well, dishing out 3.7 assists per game in addition to his usual barrage of 3-pointers (11-of-21, 52.4 percent from beyond the arc). McDermott still has to answer questions about his ability to defend wing players, but no rookie is more ready to contribute offensively.
