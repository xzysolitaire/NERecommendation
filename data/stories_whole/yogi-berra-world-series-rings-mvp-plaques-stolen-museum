LITTLE FALLS, N.J. -- Authorities say several of Yogi Berra's World Series rings and two MVP plaques were stolen from a museum honoring the New York Yankees Hall of Famer. The break-in occurred Wednesday morning at the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center. Montclair State University Police Chief Paul Cell detailed the missing items Thursday. The museum opened in the late 1990s. It is located on the university's campus in the northern New Jersey community of Little Falls. In addition to the baseball exhibits and memorabilia, it offers children's educational programs that focus on sportsmanship and social justice. The Essex County Crimestoppers program is offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the burglary. Berra won 10 World Series titles with the Yankees. He is now 89.
