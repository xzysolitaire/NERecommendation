MINNEAPOLIS -- Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah says he will not play for France in this summer's World Cup of Basketball. "It wouldn't be fair first of all, for my teammates, to even think about anything past today," Noah told ESPNChicago.com after Wednesday's shootaround. "When the French people ask me about [playing], it's hard to predict what's going to happen next year, or in two years. I live my life day to day, and I feel like the NBA season is, it's brutal. To play all year, I think it's something that is too much for me. So definitely not this year." Noah played for France during the 2012 summer but bowed out before the Olympics began due to ongoing problems with plantar fasciitis. He has talked openly about how much he wants to represent France in the Olympics one day, but is choosing to take some time off this summer after a 2013-14 season in which he has been playing the best basketball of his career. He comes into Wednesday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves averaging 12.5 points, 11.1 rebounds and 5.2 assists a game.
