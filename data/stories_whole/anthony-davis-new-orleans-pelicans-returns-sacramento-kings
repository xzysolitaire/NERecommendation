NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans coach Monty Williams says Anthony Davis is returning to the lineup for Monday night's game against Sacramento. Davis, who averages 21.3 points, 10.3 and 2.9 blocks, has been out since the first quarter of last Friday's victory over Utah with a sore left ankle. Davis also sat out the Pelicans' loss at San Antonio on Saturday. Williams says guard Eric Gordon remains out for a sixth straight game The Kings, meanwhile, are expected to be without guard Isiah Thomas. Sacramento coach Mike Malone says Thomas is still bothered by a right quad contusion and rookie Ray McCallum will start in his place.
