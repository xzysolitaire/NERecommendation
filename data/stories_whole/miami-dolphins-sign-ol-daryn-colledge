The Miami Dolphins have made their first move to try to alleviate the loss of injured Pro Bowl center Mike Pouncey, signing veteran offensive lineman Daryn Colledge to a one-year contract on Monday, the team announced. Colledge, 32, worked out for the Dolphins on Monday and did enough to impress the coaching staff and front office. Colledge has 124 career starts and also played five years with the Green Bay Packers when current Dolphins coach Joe Philbin was an assistant. The Dolphins have been looking for help on the offensive line since Pouncey had significant hip surgery last week that is expected to keep him out at least 3-4 months. Colledge has nearly all of his experience at guard, and it is unknown at this point if Miami will keep him at guard or try him at center. But Monday's signing offers some flexibility. Miami has several in-house options to play center. Backups Sam Brenner, Nate Garner and current starting right guard Shelley Smith are all possibilities to replace Pouncey. Under this scenario, Colledge will have a chance to compete for a starting job at either guard position. The Dolphins are expected to have five new starters on their offensive line to start the regular season.
