CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte Bobcats coach Steve Clifford says he expects starting power forward Josh McRoberts to return for Wednesday night's game against the Washington Wizards. McRoberts has missed the last three games with a sprained left ankle. Clifford said McRoberts felt "a lot better" during Tuesday's practice and "I would be confident that he'd be able to play" against Washington. The Bobcats (39-38) trail the Wizards by one game in the race for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. A win would give Charlotte the head-to-head tiebreaker over Washington. The 6-foot-10 McRoberts is averaging 8.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.2 assists this season. Rookie Cody Zeller filled in with McRoberts out and helped the Bobcats win three straight games and clinch their first playoff berth since 2010.
