NEWARK, Del. -- A major sector of the United Church of Christ is calling for a boycott of the Washington Redskins until the team changes its name. The Central Atlantic Conference passed a resolution Saturday to become the latest organization to denounce a name that has frequently been condemned as a racial slur. The conference said it will urge its 40,000 members in D.C., New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and parts of Virginia and West Virginia to boycott the team's games and merchandise. Conference minister Rev. John Deckenback said changing the name won't solve the problems of Native Americans, but it "can send a strong message." There has been increasing pressure over the year for the Redskins to change the name. Team owner Dan Snyder has vowed he will never do so.
