ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Hawks have requested waivers on forward John Salmons. The move announced Friday was expected after the Hawks acquired Salmons from Toronto last week. Atlanta dealt away guard Lou Williams and the rights to Brazilian center Lucas Nogueira in a move to clear space under the salary cap. By paying the $1 million buyout of Salmons' $7 million salary, the Hawks will have about $11.5 million for additional signings. They opened free agency by formally announcing a deal for Oklahoma swingman Thabo Sefolosha. The 34-year-old Salmons averaged 5.2 points in 78 games for the Raptors last season.
