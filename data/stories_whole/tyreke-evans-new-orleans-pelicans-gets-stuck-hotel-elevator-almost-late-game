PHOENIX -- New Orleans Pelicans forward Tyreke Evans was a late arrival for Friday night's game against Phoenix because he was stuck in an elevator at the team hotel. Coach Monty Williams said he took a chance and put Evans in the starting lineup assuming he would free himself in time for the game. Evans arrived at US Airways Center about an hour before tipoff. It wasn't known how long Evans was stuck, but he was still there when Williams spoke to the media at 7 p.m.
