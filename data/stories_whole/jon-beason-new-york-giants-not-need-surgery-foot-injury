EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New York Giants announced Tuesday that middle linebacker Jon Beason, who tore a ligament and fractured the sesamoid bone in his right foot last week in OTA practice, will not require surgery for the injury. The Giants said Beason was examined Monday by foot and ankle specialist Robert Anderson in Charlotte, North Carolina. He had an MRI, X-rays and a CT scan, and it was determined that his foot would be immobilized for six weeks (three in a cast and three in a walking boot) and he would begin his rehab after that. "My plan is to work as hard as I can during my rehab so I can be fully recovered around the start of the regular season opener on Monday Night in Detroit," Beason said in a statement released by the team. Jameel McClain worked at middle linebacker in Beason's place with the Giants' base defense in Tuesday's minicamp practice. "That's what this league is. This league is opportunity, and the chance for players to show themselves," McClain said Tuesday. "Fortunately we will get Jon back, so we're blessed to have that. But what we have now is the chance for a lot of people to step up and step into positions that they normally wouldn't have been in, and that's always good for a football team."
