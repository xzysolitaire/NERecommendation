Tony Wroten pivoted and spun away from the baseline toward the lane -- and lost the sole of his shoe. For his experience, the Philadelphia 76ers shooting guard says he received an apology from Michael Jordan, whose Nike Air Jordan 10 sneaker split apart last Friday in the loss against Indiana. "It was more embarrassing than anything," Wroten said Wednesday, according to the Delaware News Journal. "But things happen. I got an apology from Jordan. Yeah. ... He called my agent." On the play, Wroten, 20, drove the left baseline and in his wake left the sole of his white Air Jordan as he pivoted to spin to his right. Play was briefly stopped, and Wroten ran to the locker room and retrieved a black pair. It was the third time in less than a month that an NBA player's shoe broke apart midgame. According to The News Journal's report, Manu Ginobili's and Andrew Bogut's hightops were also Nikes. The loss to the Pacers was the 76ers' 19th in a row, a streak they extended Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls with their 22nd straight loss -- four shy of the NBA record for the longest single-season losing streak. Philadelphia looks to halt the streak Friday night at home against the New York Knicks. The Cleveland Cavaliers set the mark with 26 straight losses in 2010-11. But news of Jordan's apology hasn't been the only highlight during an otherwise miserable season for Wroten, who after Wednesday night was averaging 13.5 points in 24.5 minutes per game in his first full season, which includes 15 starts in 61 games. "Everybody loves starting. It's just a different feel," Wroten said, according to The News Journal. "Personally, speaking for myself, I like starting better than coming off the bench. I feel like I play better that way. But with me, it's just a position that I'm at the 2. "It's not like when I get the rebound I just pass it to Mike." Michael Carter-Williams, that is, although Wroten and the 76ers likely wouldn't turn away "His Airness" -- or, even now, his shoes.
