GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- New York Knicks president Phil Jackson responded on Wednesday to a New York Daily News report that said that he and team owner James Dolan have had friction over personnel decisions. Responding to a question about the Daily News report, Jackson said that Dolan has "been very true to his word" thus far in his promise to give Jackson autonomy over basketball decisions. "As far as Jim Dolan's promise or his premise when I took this job that's he's going to leave basketball decisions up to me, really, he's been loyal to that promise," Jackson said. "And going forward from last week through this week, just wanting to talk to [ex-Knicks coach] Mike [Woodson] when we were through talking to him, the staff -- it's all our decision. He's been very true to his word to this point." Citing an unnamed team source, the Daily News reported on Wednesday that Jackson is looking to remove several staff members from the organization but has run into opposition from Dolan. On the day he hired Jackson last month, Dolan vowed that the 13-time NBA champion would "be in charge of all basketball decisions." Jackson's first large-scale personnel move came on Monday, when he fired Woodson and his entire coaching staff. Jackson said on Wednesday that he expects to speak with several coaches about the vacancy. Steve Kerr is widely believed to be the favorite.
