SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento KingsÂ played without their new acquisitions -- Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray -- in a 122-101 loss to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. The three players, acquired in a trade with the Toronto Raptors on Monday, can't be in uniform until Greivis Vasquez, one of four players acquired by the Raptors in the seven-player trade, passes his physical. Vasquez was delayed because he had to acquire a visa in New York. Vasquez is expected to take his physical Thursday, and all seven players -- including new Raptors Patrick Patterson, John Salmons and Chuck Hayes -- will then be activated.
