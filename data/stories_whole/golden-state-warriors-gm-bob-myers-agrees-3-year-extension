OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers has agreed to a three-year extension that will keep him under contract through the 2017-18 season. A Warriors spokesman confirmed the agreement late Thursday night. The Bay Area News Group, citing an anonymous source, first reported the deal. Myers has been Golden State's general manager since April 2012 and has been a key cog in the franchise's turnaround. The Warriors have reached the playoffs the past two seasons, and Myers has helped assemble a talented young nucleus around All-Star point guard Stephen Curry. Myers, along with co-owner Joe Lacob, also oversaw the firing of Warriors coach Mark Jackson and the hiring of Steve Kerr this offseason. Myers was a sports agent at the Wasserman Media Group when Lacob hired him in 2011 to be Golden State's assistant general manager. He was promoted a year later to replace Larry Riley as GM.
