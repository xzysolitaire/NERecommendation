Former Detroit Lions wide receiver Titus Young has been arrested again in connection with one felony charge and four misdemeanor charges. The 24-year-old Young was arrested on July 9 at 10 a.m. and as of Monday evening was being held at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles with a bail amount of $105,000. Young is facing one count of battery with serious bodily injury, a felony, and four counts of battery on school, park or hospital property -- all misdemeanors. This arrest was first reported by USA Today. Sarah Ardalani, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Young was initially supposed to be arraigned on July 10, but the case was continued until Monday. It was not clear whether or not he was arraigned Monday or the case was continued again. Young had previously been arrested and charged in 2013 in Orange County, California, for a burglary that led to four felony charges and seven misdemeanor charges. In Riverside County, California, he was arrested twice in one day on May 5, 2013 for driving under the influence and then trying to steal his car from a tow yard. The former Boise State football player was the No. 44 pick of the 2011 draft by the Detroit Lions. In his two years with Detroit, he played in 26 games, making 81 catches for 990 yards and 10 touchdowns. Young was released by Detroit in February 2013. The St. Louis Rams claimed him off waivers but he was released by the team shortly after.
