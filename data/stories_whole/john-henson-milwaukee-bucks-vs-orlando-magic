ORLANDO, Fla. -- Milwaukee Bucks center John Henson sat out Friday night's 113-102 loss to the Orlando Magic with a sprained right wrist. Drew says Henson's wrist has been bothering him recently and he was informed prior to Friday night's game that Henson would be unavailable. Larry Sanders started in his place. Henson played 22 minutes in the Bucks' loss Wednesday night to Phoenix. He became the latest Bucks player to join the injured list. Guard O.J. Mayo was also out for the third straight game with an illness. Also remaining out were centers Zaza Pachulia (right foot fracture) and Ekpe Udoh (sprained left ankle). Carlos Delfino is also still recovering from right foot surgery.
