OAKLAND, Calif. -- Banged-up big men Andrew Bogut and David Lee remain questionable to play for the Golden State Warriors against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Warriors coach Mark Jackson says both were limited during Thursday's practice. He won't announce a decision on whether either will play until Friday. Bogut strained his right knee and Lee sprained his left shoulder in the fourth quarter of Golden State's 102-94 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Monday night. Bogut banged knees with another player under the basket, while Lee was injured when his pump-fake drew Pacers center Roy Hibbert in the air and on top of him for a foul.
