Derrick Rose did not play for the Chicago Bulls in Friday night's 118-115 victory over theÂ Philadelphia 76ers. "He's out tonight," coach Tom Thibodeau said before the tipoff. "He's feeling a little bit better but not good enough to go." Thibodeau said Rose is still day to day. He would not rule the star point guard out of Saturday night's game against the Boston Celtics. "We'll see [Saturday]," the coach said. "We'll see where he is. If he can go, I think he has to go. If he can't, then he doesn't. It's really that simple. It's the only way he's going to shake the rust off is getting out there and playing." Rose did not participate in Friday's morning shootaround after tweaking his sprained ankles in Wednesday's win over the Milwaukee Bucks.
