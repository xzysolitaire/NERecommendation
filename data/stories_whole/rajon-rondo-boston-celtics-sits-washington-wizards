The Boston Celtics said point guard Rajon Rondo sat out Wednesday night's 113-111 overtime win against the Washington Wizards as a precautionary measure. After missing nearly a full year following ACL, Rondo returned to game action on Friday. He has played the past three games on a minutes restriction, but the Celtics will exercise caution on the tail end of a back-to-back. "This is Rondo's preseason right now," coach Brad Stevens said before Wednesday's game. "[It's] not fair to him that it happens in the middle of January." Rondo played a season-high 26 minutes in Tuesday's loss in Miami. He's expected to return to action when the Celtics host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. Boston is also expected to be without starting shooting guard Avery Bradley, who sprained his right ankle during Tuesday's loss in Miami. Stevens said Bradley is "probably out a couple of weeks." Without Rondo and Bradley, the Celtics started undrafted rookie Phil Pressey and veteran Gerald Wallace at the guard spots on Wednesday night. "Changing of the guard," Stevens quipped. "We've got a lot of new faces in the locker room anyways, so we've got obviously a unique setup here." The Celtics signed 6-foot-5 D-League guard Vander Blue to a 10-day contract Wednesday. It's the second 10-day contract added to Boston's roster, as the Celtics inked Chris Johnson out of the D-League on Friday. Boston was already playing without backup combo guard Jerryd Bayless, who sprained a toe in his left foot in Sunday's loss in Orlando, and veteran swingman Keith Bogans, who was excused from the team due to frustration about his lack of playing time.
