Chicago Bulls All-Star center Joakim Noah had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, the team announced Friday. It was a procedure deemed "minor" and performed by Bulls team physician Dr. Brian Cole. Noah is expected to rehab for the next 8-12 weeks. It is unclear exactly when Noah suffered the initial injury. He was noticeably limping during Tuesday night's Game 5 loss to the Washington Wizards and admitted after the game that he had been dealing with a knee injury. Noah enjoyed the best season of his professional career in 2013-14, earning the Defensive Player of the Year award.
