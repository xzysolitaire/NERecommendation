The Chicago Bulls are finalizing a deal with free-agent guard Aaron Brooks, according to sources close to the talks. Sources told ESPN.com that the Bulls are closing in on the addition of Brooks to give them some backcourt scoring punch off the bench. Brooks would join former All-Star big man Pau Gasol and Real Madrid star Nikola Mirotic as new additions to the team, along with prized rookie Doug McDermott. Brooks, 29, averaged 9.0 points and 3.2 assists per game while splitting last season with the Houston Rockets and Denver Nuggets.
