The Detroit Tigers extended a $15.3 million qualifying offers to pitcher Max Scherzer and first baseman-designated hitter Victor Martinez. The 30-year-old right-hander finished 18-5 last season with a 3.15 ERA, striking out a career-high 252 batters in 220 1/3 innings. He won the American League Cy Young Award in 2013 after a dominant 21-3 season where he finished with a 2.90 ERA and 240 strikeouts in 214 1/3 innings. Scherzer and the Tigers avoided arbitration last offseason, agreeing to a one-year deal worth $15,525,000. In March, the Tigers said Scherzer rejected a "substantial" long-term extension offer and the sides tabled contract talks until after the season. Scherzer has gone 82-35 with a 3.52 ERA with the Tigers since being acquired from the Diamondbacks as part of a three-team trade before the 2010 season. He also has been a solid postseason pitcher for Detroit, going 4-3 with a 3.73 ERA in 12 appearances. Martinez, who turns 36 on Dec. 23, has an MVP-caliber season in 2014, hitting .335 with 32 home runs, 102 RBIs and an American League-leading .409 on base percentage. He was paid $12 million in 2014 in the last season of a four-year, $50 million contract he signed with the Tigers before the 2011 season. In three seasons with Detroit (he missed the 2012 season with a knee injury) he hit .321 with 58 homers and 298 RBIs, getting the majority of his at-bats as a designated hitter. In 12 seasons with the Indians, Red Sox and Tigers, he has a .306 batting average, 189 homers and 927 RBIs. He's been just as successful in the postseason where he has hit .315 with 6 homers and 22 RBIs in 39 games. The duo were two of the 12 free agents to receive qualifying offers by their teams on Monday. Players have until Nov. 10 to accept the offer, though none of the 22 qualifying offers made in the previous two seasons have been accepted.
