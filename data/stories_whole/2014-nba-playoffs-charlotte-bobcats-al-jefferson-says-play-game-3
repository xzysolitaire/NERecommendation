CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bobcats center Al Jefferson was in the starting lineup for Game 3 Saturday night against the Miami Heat. Jefferson participated in Saturday morning's shootaround and says his injured left foot feels "about the same" as it did before Game 2 Wednesday night. Jefferson says, "Once I come out of the game and go back in, it may take a few seconds to get it warmed back up." Miami leads the series 2-0. Bobcats coach Steve Clifford reiterated that team physicians say Jefferson can't injure the foot any worse if he continues to play. But he says if Jefferson experiences too much discomfort he'll take him out of the game. Clifford says he received texts from other NBA coaches after Jefferson's gutsy performance on a bad foot in Game 2.
