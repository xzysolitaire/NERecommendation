DETROIT -- Pistons center Andre Drummond will miss Wednesday night's game at Denver after injuring his neck over the weekend. The team says he's questionable for Friday night's game at Phoenix. Drummond hurt himself in the first quarter of Saturday night's loss to Indiana. He appeared to be hit in the head inadvertently by the Pacers' Roy Hibbert during a scramble near the basket. Drummond is averaging 13.1 points and 12.8 rebounds a game on the season. He's shooting 62 percent from the field.
