CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Brooklyn Nets point guard Deron Williams will not return to Wednesday night's game against the Charlotte Bobcats after re-injuring his left ankle. The Nets announced Williams has a sprained ankle. Williams was taken to the locker room in the second quarter after he twisted the ankle when he landed on Kemba Walker's foot after a jump shot. Williams' ankle turned awkwardly inward and he immediately grabbed at it after hitting the floor. Williams later limped off the court under his own power. It was the same ankle that forced Williams to sit out the previous two games. Williams finished with four points and two assists in 14 minutes.
