LOS ANGELES -- Clippers guard J.J. Redick came off the bench Thursday night in a 113-107 loss to the Dallas Mavericks after missing the last 25 games because of a bulging disk in his lower back, coach Doc Rivers said. "He's playing," Rivers said. "We're going to play J.J. at a limited basis today. That's why I'm not going to start him because we can't play him a lot." Rivers said he will restrict Redick to 20-25 minutes on Thursday and evaluate him. Redick, who is averaging 15.7 points, 2.2 assists and 2.1 rebounds in 30 games this season, also missed 21 games earlier this season with a fractured right wrist. The news was not as good for Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, who will miss his third straight game Thursday with a sore left Achilles. Meanwhile, Clippers forward Danny Granger will miss his fourth straight game with a strained left hamstring. Rivers said both players likely will be sidelined at least until the playoffs. "Jamal is out for a while, and I think Danny is out for a while," Rivers said. "I'd be surprised if we saw either one of them before the playoffs maybe. That's a concern and that's where we're at right now."
