New York Knicks coach Mike Woodson is not interested in having a face-to-face meeting with team president Phil Jackson until he gets further clarification on his status, a league source said. "He just wants to know one way or the other," the source said. The Knicks' subpar performance this season has led to widespread speculation about Woodson's future with the team. On Wednesday, the coach said he'd like a resolution on whether he will return next season as soon as possible. "I think it's been enough said about my job all year with you guys," he said. "Hopefully, soon I'll know my destination in terms of where I'm going to be." Earlier Friday on "SportsCenter," ESPN's Stephen A. Smith said Woodson would prefer that Jackson reach out to his agent if he's going to fire him rather than having a face-to-face meeting to inform him that he's being let go. The New York Daily News reported Thursday night that Jackson and Woodson will talk on the phone Friday to plan a meeting or work out the terms of Woodson's departure. The paper also reported that Woodson informed the Knicks recently that he doesn't see a reason to meet formally if he's going to be fired. Woodson has coached the Knicks for the past two seasons after taking over on an interim basis in 2011 following Mike D'Antoni's resignation. He guided the Knicks to a 54-win regular season and a division title in 2012-13. The Knicks also won a playoff series for the first time in 13 seasons under Woodson's stewardship.
