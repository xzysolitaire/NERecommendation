INDIANAPOLIS -- Chuck DeVoe, part of a group of businessmen who founded the Indianapolis Pacers, has died. He was 83. Leppert Mortuary and Crematory Services funeral director Angela Johnson says DeVoe died Saturday. She did not know the cause of death. The Indianapolis Star reported family members said he died of melanoma. A moment of silence was held before the Pacers played the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday. DeVoe was team president from 1969-74 and board chairman from 1974-75. Bill York, the longtime head of statistics, says the Pacers wouldn't be in Indianapolis if DeVoe and his partners hadn't been so dedicated to keeping the team in the city. A celebration of his life will be held at the Woodstock Club in Indianapolis on Jan. 12.
