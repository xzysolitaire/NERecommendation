SAN DIEGO -- The San Diego Padres have declined right-hander Josh Johnson's $4 million option for 2015. Johnson didn't throw a pitch for the Padres in 2014 while making $8 million. He suffered an elbow injury during spring training and underwent reconstructive surgery. Johnson could return to the Padres for a lesser deal. Johnson is eligible to become a free agent on Friday, while right-hander Tim Stauffer became a free agent on Thursday.
