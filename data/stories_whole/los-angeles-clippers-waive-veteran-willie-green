The Los Angeles Clippers have waived guard Willie Green, the team announced Sunday. Green was due to make $1.4 million next season but the Clippers decided to waive him before his contract became guaranteed. The Clippers are still interested in re-signing him, according to sources. Green appeared in 55 games for the Clippers last season, making nine starts and averaging 5.0 points and 1.4 rebounds in 15.8 minutes per game. Green originally signed with Los Angeles on July 30, 2012, and played in 127 career regular-season games with the Clippers.
