If it's not last, it's first. The NBA on Friday released the style of the 10 team uniforms that will be worn Christmas Day, and the backs of the jerseys will feature players' first names. The fronts of the jerseys feature each team's primary logo in the space where the team name or city is usually spelled out. Adidas has produced the jerseys for fans to buy at retail for $110. The Christmas Day slate includes the Wizards at Knicks, Thunder at Spurs, Cavaliers at Heat, Lakers at Bulls and Warriors at Clippers.
