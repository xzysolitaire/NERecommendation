The Washington Wizards suffered another possible blow to their rotation with starting shooting guard Bradley Beal getting an MRI on his right leg Monday. The Wizards said results of the exam wouldn't be known until Tuesday. Beal, who leads the team in scoring with 20.6 points per game and the league in minutes played at 40.2, had been experiencing soreness in his lower right leg -- the leg in which he suffered a stress injury last year that prematurely ended his rookie season. News of Beal's possible injury comes on the same day that injured Wizards Otto Porter Jr., Trevor Ariza and Chris Singleton all practiced with the team. Porter, selected third overall in the 2013 draft, has been sidelined since the start of training camp with a right hip flexor injury. Ariza has been nursing a right hamstring strain and missed the team's past five games, while Singleton has yet to play this season due to a broken left foot. Coach Randy Wittman said that of the three players who returned to practice, only Ariza is expected to play Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Lakers.
