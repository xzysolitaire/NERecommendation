PHOENIX -- Mark Grace will join the staff of new Arizona Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale as assistant hitting coach. The club announced Hale's staff on Thursday, with Andy Green as third base coach and Glenn Sherlock as bench coach. Sherlock shifts from third base coach and is among six from former manager Kirk Gibson's staff who are being retained. Another is Henry Blanco, who will return as coach and will be bullpen catcher. Others returning are pitching coach Mike Harkey, first base coach Dave McKay, bullpen coach Mel Stottlemyre Jr. and hitting coach Turner Ward. Grace, who played 16 seasons in the majors and is a former Diamondbacks television analyst, was hitting coach for Arizona's Class A affiliate Hillsboro last season. Green managed the Diamondbacks' Double-A team in Mobile, Alabama, the last three seasons. The Diamondbacks fired Grace from the broadcast booth in 2012 after his second DUI arrest in 15 months, but he was later rehired as a minor league coach and instructor by the organization. He completed a four-month DUI sentence under a work-release program in 2013.
