ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes confirmed Wednesday that he was the other driver in an alleged street race Friday that ended with teammate Marcell Dareus crashing his car into a tree. "I was driving my vehicle, but like I said, it's an ongoing investigation with the Hamburg police," Hughes said. "I'm going to wait for them to figure out what they're doing." Dareus was charged with three misdemeanors and will appear in court on June 17. It's unclear whether Hughes will also be charged. Hamburg police Capt. Kevin Trask did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Hughes said there were no other players involved in the incident. Hamburg police said Tuesday that it was investigating the identity of the driver of a black Camaro that was seen street racing with Dareus on Friday afternoon.Â  Hughes participated in Bills organized team activities Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile, Bills coach Doug Marrone said he and Dareus reached a "mutual decision" for him not to participate in the remainder of OTAs, which run through June 12. Dareus will return for mandatory minicamp the following week. "It wasn't a disciplinary action," Marrone said. "We're in a voluntary period, so I have to be very careful of my language with the league. ... It was both of us sitting down and talking -- how do we move forward, how do we get this thing right -- working together, coming up with that decision." Marrone declined to say where Dareus will be for the remainder of OTAs, calling it a personal situation for the Pro Bowl defensive lineman.
