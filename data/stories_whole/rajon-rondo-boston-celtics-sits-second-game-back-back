BOSTON -- Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo, still in the infancy of his return from ACL surgery, will sit out Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers as a precaution on the second night of a back-to-back. Rondo, who returned to game action on Jan. 17, has appeared in six games, but this will be the second time he's sat out the second game of a back-to-back. Rondo played 27 minutes in Tuesday's loss to the New York Knicks and the Celtics will not take any unnecessary chances as he works his way back after missing nearly a full year of basketball. Rookie Phil Pressey takes Rondo's spot in the starting lineup and the rest of the recent starting group -- Gerald Wallace, Jeff Green, Brandon Bass, and Jared Sullinger -- remains intact. Stevens had speculated Tuesday that Rondo might be able to play in Wednesday's game, but quickly backtracked after a conversation with team trainer Ed Lacerte. "That was just me talking off the top of my head and I didn't even check before I said it. I probably should have checked first," admitted Lacerte. "It was one of those things where, I actually asked Ed a couple minutes after I talked to [reporters on Tuesday] and Ed said, 'Doubtful we would do that this early.' " The Celtics could have their entire starting backcourt on the floor as early as Boston's next game on Sunday against Orlando as Stevens offered a brief, but encouraging update on Avery Bradley and the sprained right ankle that has caused him to miss the past four games. "[Bradley is] getting a lot better, very close to coming back," said Stevens.
