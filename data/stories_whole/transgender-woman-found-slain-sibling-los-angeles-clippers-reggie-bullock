BALTIMORE -- A transgender woman found slain in Baltimore is the sibling of an NBA player. Reggie Bullock of the Los Angeles Clippers confirmed to WJZ-TV that he is the sibling of Mia Henderson, who was born Kevin Long. Bullock also sent a tweet on Wednesday paying tribute to Henderson. Baltimore police say the 26-year-old Henderson was found dead early Wednesday morning in an alley in northwest Baltimore. Police have not identified any suspects or established a motive, and they don't know yet whether there's any connection to the slaying of another transgender woman last month. Bullock is heading into his second season with the Clippers. He was a first-round draft pick last year out of the University of North Carolina.
