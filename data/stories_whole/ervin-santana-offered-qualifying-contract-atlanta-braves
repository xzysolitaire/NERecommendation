The Atlanta Braves have given pitcher Ervin Santana a qualifying offer for the 2015 season, the team announced Monday. Teams have until 5 p.m. ET Monday to extend free agents these $15.3 million qualifying offers. By doing so, teams ensure they will receive compensation picks in the 2015 first-year player draft if the offered players choose to sign elsewhere. Santana has until 5 p.m. ET on Nov. 10 to accept or decline the Braves' offer. The 31-year-old right-hander went 14-10 with a 3.95 ERA for the Braves this past season. Santana signed a one-year, $14.1 million deal with Atlanta after spending one season with the Kansas City Royals. Santana spent the first eight seasons of his career with the Los Angeles Angels. Santana, an All-Star in 2008 with the Angels, pitched a no-hitter on July 27, 2011, against the Cleveland Indians. He has a career record of 119-100 with a 4.17 ERA.
