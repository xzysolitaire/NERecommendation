With Friday night's second-round series both tied 1-1, we asked our ESPN Forecast panel to update its series predictions, given what we currently know about each team. According to the panel, both series are close calls, much like the original forecast predicted. Ultimately, the panel is sticking with Indiana and Oklahoma City both advancing in seven games despite having lost home-court advantage. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
