Miami Heat guard Roger Mason Jr. was robbed Sunday during an incident in which gunshots were fired at a Miami restaurant, Miami police confirmed to NBC 6 TV in South Florida on Tuesday. Four suspects took Mason's Rolex, as well as his sister's purse, before fleeing Ni.Do. Caffe in Miami. Two of the four suspects were later arrested, and the watch and purse were found with them in an Escalade. Mason did not speak Tuesday morning following the Heat's shootaround,Â  and the team issued a statement before the Heat's game Tuesday night against Detroit saying the player would not comment "due to the ongoing legal investigation." Heat coach Erik Spoelstra did address the situation. "It was a scary moment," he said, according to the Sun Sentinel. "We talked about it as a team. Thankfully, they came out of it [unharmed]. You have to count your blessings sometimes. There are so many unpredictable things that can happen when you think you're just going out for a nice dinner. Thankfully, everybody is safe and two of the people have been caught."
