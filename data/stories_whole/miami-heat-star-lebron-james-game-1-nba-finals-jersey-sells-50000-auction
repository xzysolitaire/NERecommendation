A jersey worn by LeBron James in Game 1 of this year's NBA Finals was sold for $50,020 in an auction on the league's official website on Tuesday night. The uniform top was worn by James for the first half of the game in San Antonio, a 110-95 loss to the Spurs that perhaps will be most remembered for the air conditioning malfunction and James later missing the game's final minutes with cramps. A league spokesperson confirmed that James, as well as the other players in the game, wore a second set of jerseys for the second half of the game due to the hot conditions. The buyer, whose identity was not disclosed, also placed the winning bids for the the Game 1 jerseys of Tim Duncan ($20,770), Kawhi Leonard ($14,020), Tony Parker ($11,020), Dwyane Wade ($10,770), Ray Allen ($5,770), Chris Bosh ($5,770), Shane Battier ($2,820) and Chris Andersen ($1,851).
