An exam on New York Giants running back David Wilson's surgically repaired neck did not show sufficient improvement Wednesday, and he will continue to be held out of contact drills in OTAs and minicamp, a source said. Wilson, though, came away from the exam feeling positive, and he expects to be cleared for full contact by training camp next month, league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. If he is not cleared, Wilson likely would have to start training camp on the physically unable to perform list and could be a candidate for injured reserve if the problem continues toward the start of the season. The Giants' and Wilson's doctors are determined to be extremely careful due to the sensitivity and potentially serious consequences of neck injuries. Wilson has been practicing with the team, but it's been almost exclusively in return drills and not in any team activity that might put him at risk for contact. The Giants signed Rashad Jennings and re-signed Peyton Hillis in free agency and drafted Andre Williams in the fourth round to address the running back position. They also return 2013 seventh-round pick Michael Cox, who showed promise as a rookie. The hope is for Wilson to return and be a big part of the backfield, but the team believes it has enough coverage there if he cannot.
