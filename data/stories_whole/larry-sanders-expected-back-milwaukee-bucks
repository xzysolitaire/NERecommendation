Milwaukee Bucks center Larry Sanders is expected to return to the court Friday night at the Brooklyn Nets, less than two months after he had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb sustained in a fight at a nightclub. The Bucks tweeted Thursday that Sanders was back on the practice court and probable to face the Nets. Sanders hurt the thumb during an altercation at a downtown Milwaukee nightclub on Nov. 3., and hasn't played since. The Bucks signed Sanders to a reported four-year, $44 million extension in the offseason after he posted career-highs of 9.8 points and 9.5 rebounds last season. His 2.8 blocks per game ranked second in the league. The 15th overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft, Sanders was averaging just 2.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in three games this season.
