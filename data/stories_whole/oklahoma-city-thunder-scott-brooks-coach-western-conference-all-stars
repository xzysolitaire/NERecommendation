NEW YORK -- Oklahoma City's Scott Brooks has earned his second All-Star coaching assignment. Brooks clinched the Western Conference spot Tuesday night when Portland lost to Memphis, guaranteeing the Thunder (36-10) will have a better winning percentage than the Trail Blazers through Sunday. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich is ineligible because he coached the West last year. Brooks, the 2010 Coach of the Year, led the West to a 152-149 victory over the East in 2012, when the Thunder eventually reached the NBA Finals before losing to Miami. Indiana's Frank Vogel will coach the East in the Feb. 16 game in New Orleans.
