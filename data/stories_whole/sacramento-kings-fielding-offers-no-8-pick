The Sacramento Kings are fielding offers from three teams for the No. 8 pick in Thursday's NBA draft, sources with direct knowledge told ESPN on Monday. Sources said the Kings have two deals that could be done prior to Thursday's 2 p.m. ET trade deadline to change the draft order and one would be a draft night deal, depending on which players are available when the Kings select. The three deals would return multiple draft picks and a veteran player to the Kings for the No. 8 pick. Sources wouldn't reveal the three teams involved in the negotiations yet, but a source said the discussions are more than talk now and the Kings are weighing the offers against the potential four players the Kings think will be available at No. 8, depending on what occurs in front of them in the lottery. The Kings have had multiple offers for the No. 8 pick but have settled on these three possible deals.
