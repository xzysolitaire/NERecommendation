Despite the loss of Paul Pierce via free agency, Kevin Garnett likes the direction of the Brooklyn Nets and is "excited" about joining them for the upcoming season. Garnett, who turned 38 in May, is due $12 million in 2014-15, which would be his 20th NBA season. He has yet to publicly announce that he's playing this season, but all indications continue to point that way. On Saturday, a league source told ESPNNewYork.com that the Nets still expect Garnett to return. Pierce elected to sign a two-year contract with the Washington Wizards for $11 million with a second-year player option, sources told ESPN.com. Pierce and Garnett had been teammates since 2007-08. They won a championship together with the Boston Celtics.
