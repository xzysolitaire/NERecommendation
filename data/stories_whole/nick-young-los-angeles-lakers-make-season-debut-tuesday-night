ATLANTA -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young will make his season debut Tuesday night against the Hawks after missing nearly six weeks with a torn ligament in his right thumb, coach Byron Scott said during the team's shootaround. Young will come off the bench for the 1-9 Lakers, Scott said. He will provide a much-needed scoring boost in the backcourt for a team that has relied heavily and almost solely on Kobe Bryant to provide any sort of offense. Bryant is leading the league in scoring (27.3 points per game) and field goal attempts (24.4 per game). Young averaged 17.9 points over 28.3 minutes in 64 appearances for the Lakers last season.
