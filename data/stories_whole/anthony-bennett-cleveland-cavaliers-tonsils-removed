CLEVELAND -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward Anthony Bennett had his tonsils and adenoids removed to help improve a sleep condition. Bennett, the No. 1 overall pick in last year's draft, underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic, the team said. Bennett had a disappointing rookie season with the Cavs, averaging just 4.2 points and 3.0 rebounds in 52 games. He got off to a slow start after missing most of last summer as he recovered from shoulder surgery. He began the season out of shape, and then it was revealed Bennett suffers from sleep apnea and asthma. The 21-year-old Canadian is expected to make a full recovery in time to play on the Cavs' summer league team in Las Vegas. Cleveland is looking for a new coach after Mike Brown was fired Monday for the second time by owner Dan Gilbert.
