Los Angeles Lakers point guard Jordan Farmar will miss at least another week with a torn left hamstring, the team announced Wednesday. Farmar had hoped he would be cleared to resume practice after having an ultrasound and being examined Wednesday by Dr. Luga Podesta of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Results showed progress, but that the injury has not healed completely. He will be re-examined on Dec. 24. Farmar had said he was hoping to play as soon as Friday, when the Lakers host the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers have been without a healthy point guard for the past week, when Steve Blake was diagnosed with an elbow injury that will keep him out at least six weeks. Steve Nash remains sidelined indefinitely. Farmar has been out since Dec. 1. "I'm getting close," Farmar said Monday night, after the Lakers' loss in Atlanta. "I'm not going to risk getting hurt again, because that doesn't help me or the team if I have to miss more games. But I'm excited. I'm feeling good." Kobe Bryant and Xavier Henry have been playing the majority of minutes at point guard since Blake, Farmar and Nash have been out. The Lakers did not plan on signing a player to fill in at point guard while their three top point guards were out, preferring instead to give those minutes to Henry and shooting guard Jodie Meeks.
