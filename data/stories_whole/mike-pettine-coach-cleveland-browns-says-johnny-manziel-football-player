BEREA, Ohio -- Cleveland Browns coach Mike Pettine shrugged at the thought when his rookie quarterback was taken in the Major League Baseball draft. Pettine said Wednesday he does not expect Manziel to sign with the San Diego Padres, who took him in the 28th round despite the fact he hasn't played baseball since high school. "He's football through and through," Pettine said. The Browns coach is well aware that another well-publicized athlete found a way to play both sports, asÂ Deion Sanders played in the NFL and MLB in the late 1980s and early '90s (and scored a touchdown and hit a home run in the same week in '89). Manziel's celebrity might draw him to try both sports -- but Pettine doesn't believe it will happen. "To me, if he had been a standout college baseball player and was doing both ..." Pettine said. Manziel has not addressed being taken by the Padres because he is not available to the media this week. "If you talk to him he'd probably ..." Pettine said before pausing. "I know somebody is waiting to tell me, 'Well we could talk to him if you'd let him.'" For the record, he spoke with a smile. "When I heard it somebody texted me about it," Pettine said, "and I didn't think it was that big a deal because I know the kid is die-hard football."
