DANVILLE, Ill. -- Former NBA player Keon Clark has received an eight-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two charges. Clark has been in the Vermilion County jail since Aug. 4. He faced weapon, drug and traffic-related charges. On Wednesday, he pleaded guilty to weapons and driving under the influence charges in two separate cases.Â Edgar County Circuit Judge Matthew Sullivan signed off on Clark's plea agreement with prosecutors. The 38-year-old Danville native and UNLV alum was 23 when he became the 13th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. The News-Gazette in Champaign reported he tearfully said in court that he has to own up to his past. Defense attorneys requested that the judge recommend Clark serve time at a state Department of Corrections drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility outside Chicago.
