Brooklyn Nets forward Paul Pierce and guard Shaun Livingston will not play on Wednesday night against the Orlando Magic at Amway Center. The team said Pierce has a right hip pointer, while Livingston has a sprained right big toe. Livingston played 28 minutes in Tuesday night's 88-87 victory against the Miami Heat, while Pierce logged 32 minutes. Given that the playoffs are fast-approaching and Wednesday night's game marks the second game of a back-to-back set, it makes sense for Nets coach Jason Kidd to rest his two starters so they can heal their minor ailments. Alan Anderson and Mirza Teletovic will start in their place. Kevin Garnett, who was given Tuesday night off to rest, will start at center. Garnett made his return to the lineup on Saturday night in Philadelphia following a 19-game absence due to back spasms. He scored 10 points and grabbed four rebounds in 13 minutes. Pierce is five points shy of becoming the 18th player in NBA history to score 25,000 or more during his career. Assuming he returns on Friday night against the Atlanta Hawks, he'd have a chance to accomplish the feat at home. Andray Blatche (illness), who missed Tuesday night's game, is inactive and will miss his second straight game due to illness.
