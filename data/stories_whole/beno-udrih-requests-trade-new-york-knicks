NEW YORK -- New York Knicks point guard Beno Udrih has requested a trade, sources told ESPNNewYork.com. League sources say the 31-year-old veteran communicated his wishes to the Knicks in recent days and the team will try to honor the request. Udrih signed with the Knicks over the summer for the veteran's minimum at $1.27 million. At the time, Udrih hoped to be a part of the Knicks' three point guard rotation along with Raymond Felton and Pablo Prigioni. Udrih filled in as New York's point guard while Felton and Prigioni were out with injuries but hasn't been in the team's rotation on a consistent basis when both point guards were healthy. With Felton and Prigioni at full health on Monday, Udrih played just four minutes in the Knicks' loss to the Brooklyn Nets. On the season, Udrih is averaging 5.9 points and 3.7 assists in 19.9 minutes per game. The nine-year veteran, holds career averages of 9.0 points and 3.6 assists per game. Udrih caused a minor stir earlier this season when he publicly questioned why he was the subject of criticism. "I kind of feel like when I do the right thing, it's not the right thing in some people's eyes. It's just tough. It's easy to point fingers when the team loses. But it comes down to, we are a team, we lose together. No matter who makes a mistake or who doesn't, it's still a team loss," Udrih said on Dec. 25. "So I think all of this stuff should be kept out of the media and not call certain people out or something. We've just got to go out there and fix it and watch video and fix it as a team." Udrih didn't specify who he meant by "some people," but coach Mike Woodson had been critical of Udrih earlier this season, particularly for a defensive lapse in the final seconds of the Knicks' mistake-filled loss to the Washington Wizards on Dec. 16. "I got pointed out a couple of times that I think it was unfortunately a team loss at the end," Udrih said.
