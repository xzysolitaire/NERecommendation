ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Hawks say center Al Horford's recovery from a torn right pectoral muscle remains on track for next season's training camp but won't allow him to play for the Dominican Republic's national team this summer. Dr. Xavier Duralde, who performed the surgery after Horford's season-ending injury in December, says Horford has been cleared only for light non-contact basketball drills. In the statement released by the Hawks on Wednesday, Duralde said Horford's recovery is progressing as expected. The All-Star center is on pace for full clearance by the start of training camp for the 2014-15 season.
