NEW YORK -- The NBA is getting its own satellite radio station. SiriusXM NBA Radio will launch Monday, with the opening day to include interviews with players, owners and league executives, plus live coverage of a game between the Los Angeles Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers. The station, which the NBA and SiriusXM will announce Thursday, also will provide live coverage of the Miami Heat-Indiana Pacers showdown Tuesday. NBA Radio on Channel 217 will showcase more than 14 live games each week and a daily schedule of NBA-focused news and talk, with hosts that include former coaches Lionel Hollins, Mike Dunleavy and Sam Mitchell. The lineup of interviews Monday features commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Adam Silver, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, and players such as Cleveland's Kyrie Irving, New Orleans' Anthony Davis, Indiana's Roy Hibbert and Detroit's Greg Monroe. Owners Steve Pagliuca of Boston and Joe Lacob of Golden State also are scheduled for the first week. Beyond the daily programming, the channel will include broadcasts on location from events such as the All-Star Game and NBA Finals.
