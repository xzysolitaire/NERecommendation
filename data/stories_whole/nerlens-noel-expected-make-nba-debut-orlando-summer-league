As Philadelphia 76ers fans set their sights on the two lottery picks the team has for the 2014 NBA draft, it's a lottery pick from the past that is also providing some excitement. Nerlens Noel confirmed to ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman on Thursday that he will take part in the Orlando Summer League. Earlier Thursday, Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie told radio station WIP that he expects Noel to make his NBA debut there. Noel missed the entire 2013-14 season after suffering a torn ACL in February 2013 as a member of the Kentucky Wildcats.Â  He was taken with the sixth overall pick by the New Orleans Pelicans in the NBA draft, then shipped to the 76ers in exchange for All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday. Noel was cleared for "limited on-court work" in January, but Philadelphia at the time said he still needed to meet "several benchmarks" in order to play for the team "to ensure a long, productive NBA career."
