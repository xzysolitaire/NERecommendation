The Brooklyn Nets and assistant coach Lawrence Frank have reached a buyout agreement, allowing the 44-year-old to join the Los Angeles Clippers and become an assistant under Doc Rivers. Last season, the Nets made Frank the highest-paid assistant coach in NBA history, giving him a six-year, $6 million contract to mentor Jason Kidd in Kidd's first season as a head coach. But their relationship quickly deteriorated, and Frank was demoted to doing daily reports. Lionel Hollins has since replaced Kidd in Brooklyn following Kidd's departure to Milwaukee. Frank had formerly served under Rivers in Boston with the Celtics and was a head coach in both New Jersey and Detroit.
