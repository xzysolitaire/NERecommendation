NEW ORLEANS -- Thunder forward Nick Collison and Pelicans guard Austin Rivers both have been ejected following a brief scuffle in the second quarter of Monday night's game between Oklahoma City and New Orleans. Rivers appeared perturbed about the way he was held up during a prolonged screen set by Collison while on Oklahoma City's offensive end. Rivers shoved his way out of the screen and soon after started jawing with Collison as the two followed the play down court to the Pelicans' offensive end. They bumped again in the paint, igniting a brief shoving match with 7:56 remaining in the first half. Officials looked at the exchange on video replay before ejecting the players, leaving New Orleans with no regular point guard. Shooting guard Tyreke Evans has taken over that spot.
