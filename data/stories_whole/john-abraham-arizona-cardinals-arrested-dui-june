GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker John Abraham was arrested June 29 on a charge of DUI, according to DeKalb County, Georgia, jail records. Abraham has not reported to Cardinals training camp yet and has missed Friday's conditioning test and the first three days of practice. Coach Bruce Arians said Saturday and Sunday that Abraham's absence was excused and called the matter "personal." It is unknown whether Abraham's absence from camp is related to his arrest. According to court documents, Abraham was booked at 5 p.m. June 29 by the Brookhaven Police Department and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and "stopping, standing or parking prohibited in specified place." He was released at 10:05 that night on bond, according to the documents. He was listed as 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds in the county's jail records -- about 40 pounds lighter than he's listed in the Cardinals' media guide. AZCentral.com first reported the arrest. In a statement released to the website, a Cardinals spokesman said the team is aware of the arrest but declined to comment further. Abraham was arrested in 2012 in Atlanta on charges of obstruction and in 2003 on charges of driving while intoxicated. He signed with the Cardinals on the first day of training camp in July 2013 and proceeded to tally 11.5 sacks. His 133.5 career sacks rank ninth on the all-time sacks list. He made his fifth Pro Bowl in 14 seasons, and his 53 tackles were his most since 2005. Abraham's arrest falls under the NFL's personal conduct policy. If he's found guilty, Abraham could be subject to discipline, which might include a suspension.
