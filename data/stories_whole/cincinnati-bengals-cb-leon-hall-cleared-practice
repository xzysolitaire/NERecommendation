CINCINNATI -- Cornerback Leon Hall was cleared to join the Bengals' first practice of training camp on Thursday, an encouraging sign for one of the NFL's top defenses. Hall tore his right Achilles tendon midway through last season, the second time he's sustained such an injury. He tore his left Achilles in 2011, but was back as the starter the following year. The 29-year-old cornerback says he'll be rusty in pass coverage, so that's the main thing he's working on early in camp. He participated in Thursday's walk-through and said he would also take part in Thursday afternoon's practice. "I guess you could say I reached my goal but that was just part of it," Hall said. "I'm still not all the way back yet. I'd still like to get out on the field, get the kinks out, if you will, get the rust off. It'll be nice." Defensive tackle Geno Atkins is coming back from a torn ACL and had hoped to participate in the first practice but did not. Also sitting out were tight end Jermaine Gresham, wide receiver Marvin Jones and Pro Bowl offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth, who was placed on the active PUP list.
