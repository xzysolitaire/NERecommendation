SANDUSKY, Ohio -- Ohio's Cedar Point amusement park is partnering with the LeBron James Family Foundation instead of renaming a roller coaster for the basketball superstar. The Sandusky park had vowed to rename a coaster "King James" if the four-time NBA MVP returned home to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers, which he did. Cedar Point says park officials and James decided the partnership announced Tuesday will have greater impact than renaming a ride. A first-ride auction next spring will benefit the nonprofit, and the park will host children involved with the foundation's programs next summer. Cedar Point has said James was a frequent visitor while he was growing up in Akron and playing in Cleveland. James left Miami this summer to return to Cleveland, where he played his first seven seasons.
