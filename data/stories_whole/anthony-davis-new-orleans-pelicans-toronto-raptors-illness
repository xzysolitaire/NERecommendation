NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis and Raptors starting center Jonas Valanciunas have been ruled out for Wednesday night's game between Toronto and New Orleans. Pelicans spokesman Matt Ryan says Davis, who is coming off career highs of 40 points and 21 rebounds in a victory over Boston on Sunday, has an upper respiratory infection. Valanciunas had been listed as questionable with a sprained lower back, and coach Dwane Casey says the 6-foot-11 center is unable to play in New Orleans. Casey says the injury means Tyler Hansbrough and Chuck Hayes will see more opportunities for playing time. Valanciunas has played in 66 games this season, averaging 10.5 points and 8.4 rebounds in 27.3 minutes per game.
