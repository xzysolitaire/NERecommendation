Oklahoma City Thunder center Kendrick Perkins is facing a misdemeanor assault charge after allegedly punching a woman and her brother outside a Houston nightclub in July, KHOU.com reported Thursday. Perkins, a Texas native, posted a $1,000 bond Thursday morning, according to the website, which cited court documents. Perkins' brother-in-law, Quincy Alpough, faces the same charge. The case was refiled after initially being dismissed. "We were made aware of the allegations," Thunder general manager Sam Presti said in a statement. "It is something we take seriously and are gathering more information. We will have no further comment at this time." According to KHOU.com, Miketta Cotton told police she and her brother were leaving the Houston nightclub Nox when their car and another "backed into each other." Cotton said she went to talk to the male driver when a female from the vehicle got out and confronted her as if to fight.Â  Cotton said she calmed the woman down, but then Alpough exited the car and pushed her, saying, "That's my cousin!" Miketta Cotton's brother, Ja'Keenan Cotton, then got out of their car to check on his sister, KHOU.com reported. He told police that Perkins, a passenger in the other vehicle, punched him in the head. Miketta Cotton, meanwhile, told police that Perkins punched her in the face with a closed fist. Another woman in the vehicle with the Cottons said Alpough elbowed her in the throat, knocking her unconscious, according to KHOU.com. All three alleged victims say a group of people then kicked them repeatedly while they were on the ground. In 2011, Perkins was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and public intoxication after an altercation in Beaumont, Texas. He was released after posting $150 bond, and the charges reportedly were dropped.
