Charlotte Bobcats small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist suffered a fractured left hand in the second half of an 89-82 loss to the Dallas MavericksÂ on Tuesday night. Kidd-Gilchrist had six points and three rebounds in 19 minutes Tuesday before leaving the game, and said he's not sure when he suffered the injury. "It was [pointing] the wrong way," Kidd-Gilchrist said of the injury. "That's it. "I was really surprised. I didn't feel anything at the time. ... It happens in this league." Bobcats coach Steve Clifford said he didn't know how long Kidd-Gilchrist would be out. In his second year, Kidd-Gilchrist is averaging 9.3 points and 5.4 rebounds per game for Charlotte (8-11). "It's going to be tough to make up for what he does," Clifford said. Kidd-Gilchrist joins Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans and Paul Pierce of the Brooklyn Nets on the recent list of high-profile players to suffer hand fractures.
