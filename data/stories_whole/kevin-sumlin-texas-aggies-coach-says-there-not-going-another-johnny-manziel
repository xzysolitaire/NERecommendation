HOOVER, Ala. -- Texas A&M must move on with a new quarterback in 2014, but that doesn't mean the previous one was absent from the discussion at SEC media days on Tuesday. Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin discussed the transition to a new signal-caller after the departure of record-setting quarterback Johnny Manziel, who was a first-round draft pick by the Cleveland Browns. A&M will turn to a young quarterback this season, either sophomore Kenny Hill or true freshman Kyle Allen. "I understand there's not going to be another Johnny Manziel, the way he played the game," Sumlin said. "That's all part of it. Now, does that mean that we change offensively? Maybe. Does that mean that we changed offensively for him? That might be the case, too." Sumlin touted the credentials of the two quarterbacks on his roster, neither of whom have started a college game even though both were well-regarded recruits. "You wouldn't be so excited if you hadn't recruited the Gatorade Player of the Year out of the state of Texas at quarterback [Hill] and the No. 1 quarterback in the country [Allen] behind him. ... What we have done is we've gone out and been able to recruit very, very well to a system that we believe in." As for a timetable on naming a starter, Sumlin pointed to the middle of preseason training camp. "I didn't come here today to tell you who the quarterback was going to be. ... That will play itself out," Sumlin said. "I think we're looking at a couple weeks before we play South Carolina that we'll name a starter." When asked about Manziel's eventful offseason, which has produced several photos on social media of Manziel partying across the country on the weekends, Sumlin made it clear he's looking forward, not backward. "That's a great question ... about the Cleveland Browns," Sumlin said, grinning.
