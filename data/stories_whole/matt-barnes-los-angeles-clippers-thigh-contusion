MIAMI -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Matt Barnes will be sidelined for Thursday night's game against the Miami Heat because of a right thigh contusion and will likely be out for the rest of the week. He also missed Wednesday night's 98-90 loss to the Magic. Barnes suffered the injury in the second quarter of the Clippers' 137-118 win Monday against the Houston Rockets when he was kneed by Greg Smith. Barnes tried to play in the second half but was unable to, and said he felt worse on Wednesday. "I feel horrible," Barnes told ESPNLosAngeles.com. "I tried to keep it loose and ride a bike and do all the stuff during the game but [then] I just couldn't move it." Barnes said he will try to play Saturday against the Rockets in Houston but Clippers coach Doc Rivers said he didn't want him to play during the team's three-game road trip. "I don't think he'll play on the trip," Rivers said Thursday. "I know he wants to play Saturday but I don't think so. I just want Matt to get healthy and play and that doesn't work a lot of times. We're just going to sit him and rest him and see if we can get him right." Barnes continued to get treatment Thursday and said he will continue to do so through the weekend. "It's pretty sore," Barnes said. "I've never had this before. It feels as bad as it felt when I tore my groin, but they checked it out and it's just a deep contusion. It's going to take some time to get loose, but it's day by day right now."
