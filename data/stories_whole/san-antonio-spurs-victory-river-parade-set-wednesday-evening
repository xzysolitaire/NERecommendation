SAN ANTONIO -- To the victor come the spoils, and San Antonio plans to spoil its NBA champion Spurs with a victory river parade and Alamodome rally. The Spurs will receive their tribute Wednesday evening as they float on barges down the San Antonio River with fans on the downtown River Walk. After that, Mayor Julian Castro will headline a ceremony at the Alamodome, where the Spurs will be honored for their fifth NBA championship. The events will be televised locally and webcast on Spurs.com. The Spurs defeated the Miami Heat in five games, sealing their title Sunday.
