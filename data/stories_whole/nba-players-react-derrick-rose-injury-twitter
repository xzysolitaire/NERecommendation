Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose -- who missed the entire 2012-13 season after tearing his left ACL in the 2012 playoffs -- left Friday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a right knee injury. Rose is scheduled to have an MRI in Los Angeles on Saturday. Before that happens, many of his NBA colleagues took to Twitter to wish him the best.
