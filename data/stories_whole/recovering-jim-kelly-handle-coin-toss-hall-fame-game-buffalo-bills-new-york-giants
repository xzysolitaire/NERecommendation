CANTON, Ohio -- Former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who is recovering from cancer treatments, will participate in the coin toss at the Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 3. The Hall of Famer will represent Buffalo as an honorary captain, while former linebacker Harry Carson will be the New York Giants' honorary captain when the teams face off in the first NFL preseason game. Kelly, inducted into the hall in 2002, in May completed radiation and chemotherapy sessions to treat sinus cancer, which spread from his jaw. "I have always said that God willing, I will be back in Canton every summer," Kelly said. "This year especially, I am so thankful that I can be on hand to share in a great weekend that shines the spotlight on the Buffalo Bills. There isn't a person more deserving of joining the Hall of Fame than my teammate and friend Andre Reed. "It is also a great honor for me to represent the Bills organization at the coin toss to kick off the season. The entire experience will bring back many great memories from 2002 when so many of the Bills family -- fans, players, and staff -- joined me in Canton for one of the most memorable times of my life." The other inductees this year are Derrick Brooks, Ray Guy, Claude Humphrey, Walter Jones, Michael Strahan, and Aeneas Williams. Those ceremonies are on Aug. 2. Carson was inducted in 2006.
