The Los Angeles Lakers are considering signing free-agent forward Michael Beasley and brought in the six-year veteran for a workout at their El Segundo, California, practice facility Wednesday, according to multiple sources. "[Beasley] looked very good and he has been working out," one source said. "A tiny rust from layoff, but [he] did a good job." The former No. 2 pick in the 2008 draft averaged 7.9 points and 3.1 rebounds in 15.1 minutes per game for the Miami Heat last season. While Beasley showed improvement from his previous season when he played with the Phoenix Suns, upping his shooting percentage from 40.5 to 49.9 percent and his 3-point percentage from 31.3 to 38.9 percent, he was out of Miami's rotation by the playoffs, appearing in just four of the Heat's 20 postseason games on their run to the NBA Finals. Beasley, 25, has already played for three teams -- Miami, Phoenix and Minnesota -- during his relatively short career. He has career averages of 13.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. This isn't the first time the Lakers have expressed interest in the 6-foot-10, 235-pound small forward. The Lakers attempted to trade for Beasley twice during the 2011-12 season, when he played for the Timberwolves, but both deals fell through, the second just minutes before the trade deadline expired. Beasley would give Los Angeles some added depth at the small forward position. Wes Johnson, who re-upped for another season with the Lakers this summer, is the only true 3 on their roster, with Xavier Henry, Nick Young and Kobe Bryant, and possibly even Julius Randle and Ryan Kelly, able to play out of position to fill the role. The Lakers currently have 12 players under contract, a number that will rise to 13 when they settle on terms with second-round draft pick Jordan Clarkson.
