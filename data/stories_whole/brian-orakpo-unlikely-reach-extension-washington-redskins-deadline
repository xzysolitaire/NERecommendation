Linebacker Brian Orakpo and the Washington Redskins are unlikely to agree to a long-term extension by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline, sources confirmed to ESPN. Orakpo signed an $11.45 million franchise tender earlier this offseason but made it known that he'd welcome a long-term deal with Washington, which drafted him 13th overall in 2009. Though he's been an effective player since, his career-best sack total is 11, which was set as a rookie. He's coming off a 10-sack season and has never recorded fewer than seven when he's played a full season. In March, first-year Redskins coach Jay Gruden said he "wouldn't mind letting (Orakpo) play out this franchise tag and see what happens." "He's a talented player," Gruden said. "I think he can do a little better, we can ask more of him to where he could be more productive."
