Tight endÂ Vernon Davis says he plans on being present at the San Francisco 49ers' mandatory minicamp next week after sitting out the voluntary sessions because of his contract. "You know what? I plan on being there," Davis said Thursday in a radio interview with San Francisco station 95.7 The Game. "I plan on being there." Davis told ESPN.com last week: "If it's mandatory, I think I should be there. My foot could get stuck in the grass, and I may not be able to get out ... but if it's mandatory, I think I should be there." While it appears Davis will not hold out, the 49ers still have to worry about guard Alex Boone. Boone hasn't been at the voluntary sessions, either. There have been indications that Boone plans to stay away until he gets a new contract. Both Davis and Boone have two seasons remaining on their contracts.
