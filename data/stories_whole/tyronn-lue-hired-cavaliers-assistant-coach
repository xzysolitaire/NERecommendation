The Cleveland Cavaliers have lured Tyronn Lue away from the Los Angeles Clippers to join new coach David Blatt's staff in what sources told ESPN.com is one of the most lucrative deals for an assistant coach in the NBA. Lue, who has been an assistant with the Boston Celtics and Clippers with Doc Rivers over the past five seasons, will make about $1 million per season to work with the Cavs' young guards, Kyrie Irving and Dion Waiters, sources said. "Over the past several weeks, it became clear that Ty could play a key role in our team's future success," Cavaliers general manager David Griffin said in a statement. "Ty fits our culture and vision for the franchise. His successful experience as both a player and coach is going to help us tremendously." Cavs owner Dan Gilbert has been aggressive in spending on coaches over the past several years. Mike Brown was fired one year into a five-year contract worth $20 million in May, and Blatt signed a three-year, $10 million deal with a team option for a fourth season. "I wouldn't be in the position to make this career move and advancement without the deep support, mentorship and friendship that I have received and enjoyed from Doc Rivers," Lue said in the statement. "I want to thank Doc for helping prepare me so well for this next step and challenge. Cleveland is a great opportunity. I am looking forward to joining Coach Blatt, David Griffin and the entire Cavaliers organization at a very exciting and promising time for the franchise." The Cavs interviewed Lue twice, and he was a finalist for the head-coaching job before the team decided to hire Blatt last week after his 20-year coaching career in Europe and the Middle East. Alvin Gentry, who also interviewed for the Cavs' head job, left Rivers' staff with the Clippers to join the Golden State Warriors' coaching staff last week. Blatt will be introduced as the Cavs' coach at a news conference Wednesday.
