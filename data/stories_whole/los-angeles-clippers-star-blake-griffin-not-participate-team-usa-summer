LOS ANGELES -- Clippers forward Blake Griffin will not participate on the USA Basketball men's national team this summer, he announced Thursday. Griffin was one of 19 players selected to the U.S. roster from which the 2014 World Cup of Basketball team will be selected. "I appreciate the invitation to play for Team USA this summer," Griffin said in a statement. "It is a special opportunity anytime you have a chance to represent your country, and I was honored to be included. However, right now I want to focus and dedicate 100 percent of my energy on improving and preparing for the upcoming season with the Clippers." Griffin was forced to miss the 2012 Summer Olympics in London after he was diagnosed with a medial meniscus tear in his left knee that required arthroscopic surgery and sidelined him for two months. Earlier Thursday, ESPN.com's Marc Stein reported that Washington Wizards guard John Wall had accepted USA Basketball's invitation to attend its training camp next week in Las Vegas.
