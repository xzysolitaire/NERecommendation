CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving is back in the lineup after missing three games with a bruised left knee. Irving is starting Tuesday night against Philadelphia. The third-year pro was sidelined after injuring his knee on an awkward fall last week at Indiana. Irving said he may have overreacted after going down, but that he was "scared to death" that he was hurt more seriously. Irving felt a "pop" in his knee, but an MRI showed no structural damage. Irving called it a "weird" injury and said he didn't want to come back until he was 100 percent. He leads the Cavs in scoring at 22.2 points per game. Irving started 31 consecutive games before he was injured. He missed 38 games in his first two NBA seasons with a variety of injuries.
