Former Utah Jazz broadcaster and NBA All-Star Rod Hundley has Alzheimer's. Hundley, 79, was the voice of the Jazz from the franchise's first season in New Orleans in 1974 until his retirement in 2009. His partner, Kim Reardon, told The Salt Lake Tribune this week that Hundley's disease is in a "moderate" stage. Despite his illness, Hundley plans to attend next week when the Jazz honor former coach Jerry Sloan, the Tribune reported. Hundley passed his TV play-by-play duties to Craig Bolerjack in 2005 but stayed on the radio until he retired. "Hot Rod" Hundley starred at West Virginia and was the No. 1 pick in the 1957 NBA draft. He spent six years with the Lakers and was selected to the All-Star Game in 1960 and 1961.
