NEW YORK -- Baseball has suspended a pair of pitchers for positive tests under its minor league drug program, including a 72-game ban for free agent Luis Morel. Morel, a 21-year-old right-hander, tested positive for a metabolite of Stanozolol. He was 1-2 with a 4.44 ERA in 10 relief appearances this year for Baltimore's Dominican Summer League team. His suspension will start when he signs with a major league organization. San Francisco's Adalberto Mejia got a 50-game penalty for a stimulants infraction after he tested positive for Sibutramine. Mejia is a 21-year-old left-hander who was 7-9 with a 4.67 ERA in 21 starts and one relief appearance this year for Double-A Richmond. There have been 62 suspensions this year under the minor league drug program.
