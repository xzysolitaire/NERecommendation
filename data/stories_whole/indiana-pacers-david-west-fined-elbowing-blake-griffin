NEW YORK -- Pacers forward David West has been fined $15,000 for elbowing the Clippers' Blake Griffin in the jaw. West was assessed a flagrant foul 2 and ejected at the end of the first half of Indiana's 106-92 win Saturday. The NBA announced the fine Sunday. The league also fined Kings coach Michael Malone $25,000 for screaming at official Marc Davis after Sacramento's 91-90 loss to the Grizzlies on Friday. Davis called a jump ball instead of a foul against Memphis with 1.9 seconds left and Sacramento trailing by a point, and the Grizzlies won the jump ball. Malone was fined for verbal abuse of an official and not proceeding directly to his locker room after the game ended.
