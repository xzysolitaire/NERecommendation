We asked our ESPN Forecast panel who would prevail in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals, and it sees the two-time defending NBA champions advancing to a fourth consecutive Finals. The panel thinks the Heat will handle the Pacers in six games, even though Indiana is the top seed in the conference and has home-court advantage. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
