PHOENIX -- Suns general manager Ryan McDonough is plotting the team's future after an unexpectedly successfully season, and he's confident that future includes Eric Bledsoe. McDonough says the backcourt of Bledsoe and Goran Dragic is as good as any in the league. Bledsoe is a restricted free agent and McDonough has repeatedly said the Suns will match any offer another team may make. He says the Suns would prefer to work out a deal before free agency begins. Bledsoe was noncommittal when asked this week if he wanted to remain with the Suns. But McDonough says he has no indication that Bledsoe was unhappy in Phoenix.
