CLEVELAND -- LeBron James is a well-known Dallas Cowboys fan, but the starting quarterback of the 3-2 Browns hopes to convert the Cleveland Cavaliers star to the hometown NFL team. Brian Hoyer said he understands why the 29-year-old James, an Akron native, might support the Cowboys. Hoyer, also 29, is from Cleveland, and he and James were in elementary school when the Browns left for Baltimore in 1995 and became the Ravens. The Browns franchise began again in Cleveland in 1999. "You have to cheer for someone," Hoyer said. "Hopefully we can bring him around to it." After six straight double-digit-loss seasons, the Browns have a chance to climb well above .500 with upcoming games with the Jaguars, Raiders and Buccaneers, who have combined for one win. James on Monday posted an Instagram message trumpeting his Cowboys after their victory over Seattle. But James also gave some love to the Browns on Sunday morning in a tweet: "It was a great day," James said Monday. "Browns won. Cowboys won. I had a great Sunday."
