NEW YORK -- The San Diego Padres have won the bidding for rights to South Korean pitcher Kwang Hyun Kim with a $2 million offer and have 30 days to reach a deal with the 26-year-old left-hander. Major League Baseball said Thursday the Padres had submitted the highest bid for Kim, who was put up for bid by the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball Organization. San Diego would be required to pay the fee only if it reaches an agreement to sign the player.
