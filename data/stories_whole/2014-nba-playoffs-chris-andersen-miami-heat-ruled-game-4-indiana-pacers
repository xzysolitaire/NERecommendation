MIAMI -- Key Miami Heat backup big man Chris Andersen is out for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals with a left thigh bruise. In a related move, coach Erik Spoelstra promoted Rashard Lewis into the starting lineup at power forward against the Indiana Pacers. Andersen suffered the injury in the first half of the Heat's Game 3 victory but continued to play, though he seemed to be limited. He's been battling several nagging injuries during the playoffs, including a right shin injury. Andersen also dealt with a foot injury during the regular season. "He's a human bruise right now," Spoelstra said. Andersen has been an important backup over the past two seasons and especially in this series, averaging 7.0 points and 7.0 rebounds in the first three games against Indiana. The Heat, already without much size, have activated little-used Greg Oden in case he is needed. More likely the Heat will slide Udonis Haslem into Andersen's role as the first big man off the bench now that Lewis has been promoted to starter. Lewis was effective defensively off the bench in Game 3. The Heat are listing Andersen has day to day.
