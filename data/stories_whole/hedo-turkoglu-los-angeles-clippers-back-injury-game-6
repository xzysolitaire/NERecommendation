SAN FRANCISCO -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Hedo Turkoglu will miss Game 6 of the team's first-round series against the Golden State Warriors with a lower back contusion. "He's out," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "He's not doing well enough." Turkoglu, who is averaging 3.2 points and one rebound in 8.2 minutes per game this series, will be re-evaluated when the team returns to Los Angeles. However, he isn't expected to play this week. The 35-year-old suffered the injury in Tuesday's Game 5 while defending Warriors forward David Lee in midair. Turkoglu was knocked to the ground as Lee picked up an offensive foul with 7:47 left in the third quarter. As players tried to pick up Turkoglu after his injury, he brushed them off as he was writhing in pain during the duration of a timeout before being helped back to the locker room.
