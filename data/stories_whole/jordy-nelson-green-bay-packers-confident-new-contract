GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Jordy Nelson watched fellow receivers Greg Jennings and James Jones play out the final year of their contracts with the Green Bay Packers and then leave in free agency the last two offseasons. He does not have the same vibe about himself. Although talks have not progressed to the point where a contract extension is imminent, the 29-year-old believes something could get done soon. "Everyone knows deals get done closer to training camp," Nelson said Tuesday after the Packers' organized team activities practice. Nelson, who is coming off career highs in receptions (85) and yards (1,314), is in the final season of a three-year, $12.6 million contract extension he signed in 2011. The deal turned out to be a bargain for the Packers. Now, Nelson is at almost the same age that Jennings was when he signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2013 and Jones was when he signed with the Oakland Raiders this offseason. "I think it's a little bit different because we've gotten a lot younger," Nelson said. "If I were to walk and you've got Randall [Cobb], who could possibly walk, now you're down to all rookies besides [Jarrett Boykin]. I think it'll be different. I wouldn't be surprised if stuff starts picking up soon now that the draft and everything's done with. There's a time frame they work off of, so I've been informed of that, so we'll just wait and see when it hits." The Packers drafted three receivers -- Fresno State's Davante Adams (second round), Wisconsin's Jared Abbrederis (fifth round) and Saginaw Valley State's Jeff Janis (seventh round) -- this season to join Nelson, Cobb and Boykin. Like Nelson, Cobb is entering the final year of his contract. The Packers should have the salary-cap space ($13,958,808) to get both deals done. "That's for the Packers to decide and figure out," Cobb said.
