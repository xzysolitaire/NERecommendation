OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Golden State Warriors say an MRI on forward David Lee's left leg showed a strained hamstring and that he will be re-evaluated in two weeks. The team announced the diagnosis Friday, a day after Lee underwent the exam. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Thursday that Lee would not travel with the team for games at Houston on Saturday and Phoenix on Sunday. The two-time All-Star forward sat out the first three games of the season because of a strained hamstring. He scored six points in seven minutes in the first half of Golden State's 121-104 win over the Clippers on Wednesday night before hurting his hamstring again. "I just feel bad for David because he's had a great preseason, and he's worked so hard," Kerr said Thursday. "You saw the impact he made on the game immediately, and for this to happen, I feel bad for him. Hopefully we get him back soon and he'll be back in the mix, and we'll go from there." Draymond Green will continue to start in Lee's place. Marreese Speights and Harrison Barnes are also expected to see time at power forward. The Warriors are off to a 4-0 start, and Kerr credited the team's improved depth for overcoming Lee's absence so far.
