DOVER, Del. -- Philadelphia 76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams is unsure when he'll return to play following offseason shoulder surgery. Carter-Williams, the NBA rookie of the year, had surgery in May to repair the labrum of his right shoulder. Sixers coach Brett Brown said Carter-Williams has not been cleared to play for the start of training camp on Tuesday. Carter-Williams was only the third player since 1950-51 to lead all rookies in scoring (16.7), rebounding (6.3) and assists (6.2), joining Oscar Robertson (1960-61) and Alvan Adams (1975-76). Allen Iverson is the only other player in Sixers history to win the rookie award. Carter-Williams says he's been shooting for about 2Â½ months and expects to be ready for the start of the regular season. Carter-Williams was the grand marshal for Saturday's NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Dover International Speedway.
