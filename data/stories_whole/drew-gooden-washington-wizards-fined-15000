NEW YORK -- Washington forward Drew Gooden has been fined $15,000 by the NBA for attempting to throw the Lakers' Nick Young to the floor during the Wizards' victory Friday night. League president of operations Rod Thorn says Saturday that Gooden committed an unnecessary act when he clamped Young's arm with 2:14 remaining in the game. Gooden was called for a flagrant foul 2 and automatically ejected.
