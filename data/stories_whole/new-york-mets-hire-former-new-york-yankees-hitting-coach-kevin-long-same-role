NEW YORK -- Kevin Long is switching boroughs, but remaining in New York City. Shortly after being fired as hitting coach with the Yankees, the Mets have hired Long for the same role. "Kevin's experience, success and wealth of knowledge make him the perfect fit as our hitting instructor," general manager Sandy Alderson said in a statement on Thursday. "This is a very positive step for the Mets. We welcome Kevin and his wife Marcey to the Mets family." Said Long: "I'm excited to get the opportunity to work with a team that I think is on the rise. I had a great meeting with Sandy and [manager] Terry [Collins] yesterday and I can't wait to get started and help in any way I can." Long, 47, had served as Yankees hitting coach for eight seasons. He succeeds Lamar Johnson, who will return to a role in the minor leagues. Johnson had been promoted in May with the firing of hitting coach Dave Hudgens. Hudgens since has been hired by the Houston Astros as hitting coach. The Mets also announced the promotion of Dustin Clarke from Triple-A Las Vegas to serve as strength and conditioning coach.
