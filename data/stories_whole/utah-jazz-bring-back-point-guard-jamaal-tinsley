Burke is expected to miss two to three months after breaking a finger in the team's third preseason game. Tinsley, a 10-year veteran, spent the last two seasons in Utah, where the point guard averaged 3.6 points and 4.0 assists. He has also played for Indianapolis and Memphis and has career averages of 8.6 points and 6.1 assists.
