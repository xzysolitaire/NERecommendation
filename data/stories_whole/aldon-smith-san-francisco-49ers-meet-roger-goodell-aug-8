San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith, facing a significant suspension, is scheduled to meet with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in New York City next Friday, Aug. 8, according to a league source. It will continue a busy time for Goodell, who is scheduled to meet with former Cowboys tackle Josh Brent within the next week and Smith next Friday. Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon's appeal will be heard this Friday, but not by Goodell, who will be in Canton, Ohio, for the Pro Football Hall of Fame festivities.Â  Each player wants an answer as soon as possible, as do their teams, so they all can plan for the season ahead. Smith is facing suspension for his behavior and off-field actions that include three felony gun charges and a DUI. Smith, who said earlier this month that he's been sober since September, voluntarily missed five games last season when he entered a substance-abuse treatment center. In October in London, Goodell told reporters that the league might consider Smith's aggressive approach to his problem when potential discipline would be addressed. Also, in April, Smith was arrested for an alleged fake bomb threat. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office declined to press charges. Smith, the No. 7 overall draft pick in 2011, has 42 sacks in 43 regular-season games.
