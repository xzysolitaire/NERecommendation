Michael Jordan laughed off the one-one-one challenge from fellow NBA owner Robert Pera on Wednesday. "I think that's comical,'' Jordan told the Charlotte Observer. "It didn't make any sense. Why would I play one one-on-one? It's a no-win situation for me no matter what." Pera, entering his second season in charge of the Memphis Grizzlies, challenged the Charlotte Bobcats owner and third-leading scorer in NBA history to a game of one-on-one earlier this week, with $1 million going to charity. That proposal came in a Twitter exchange Monday where Pera apologized about the cancellation of a one-on-one showdown against Grizzlies guard Tony Allen, which would have resulted in a $100,000 donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Someone suggested the Grizzlies owner just change it to an owners match with Pera facing off against Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks. Pera's response was he would make quick work of Cuban, so instead he called out Jordan. Pera, whose Twitter avatar shows him in mid-jump shot with a shooting sleeve on his left arm, has posted a video of him working out on the Grizzlies' practice court, connecting on mid-range jumpers.
