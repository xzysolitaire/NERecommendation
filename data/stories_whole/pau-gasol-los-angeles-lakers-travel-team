Pau Gasol, still suffering from symptoms related to his bout of vertigo over the weekend, did not travel with the Los Angeles Lakers when they left for their two-game trip through Milwaukee and Minnesota on Wednesday, according to the team. Gasol visited ear, nose and throat specialist Dr. John Rehm and it was determined to keep Gasol back in Los Angeles for rest and recovery. The 13-year veteran is not expected to meet the team by taking a commercial flight later in the week. Gasol is officially being listed as day to day, although he has not been cleared for basketball activities after leaving Sunday's 103-94 win over the Orlando Magic because of dizziness and nausea and spending the night in the hospital after receiving three liters of fluids through an IV. Gasol is expected to visit Dr. Rehm on a daily basis to monitor his progress. Chris Kaman, who started at center and put up 13 points and nine rebounds in the Lakers' 127-96 rout of the New York Knicks on Tuesday, is expected to continue to fill in for Gasol with the first unit. Injured guards Jordan Farmar (right groin) and Steve Nash (right hamstring) accompanied the Lakers on their road trip, but are unlikely to provide much more than moral support. Farmar has already been ruled out for both games and Nash, who returned from a five-week absence to play 19 minutes in a game last week before sitting out the next two games, is considered questionable to play on the trip.
