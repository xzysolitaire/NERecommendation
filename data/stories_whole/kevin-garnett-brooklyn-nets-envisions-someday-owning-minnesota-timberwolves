Brooklyn Nets power forward Kevin Garnett has sky-high ambitions for his post-playing days. Garnett told Yahoo! Sports on Thursday that he would like to become the owner of his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I want to buy the Timberwolves," he said. "Put a group together and perhaps someday try to buy the team. That's what I want." Garnett spent his first 12 seasons in Minnesota, where he became a superstar after being selected by the Timberwolves in the first round (No. 5 overall) of the 1995 draft. The 38-year-old is in his 20th season in the league. He is also in the final year of his contract (he will make $12 million in 2014-15). It is unknown if this will be Garnett's final season. He is averaging 8.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in 23.0 minutes per game for the Nets (4-4). Garnett has made more than $315 million in on-court earnings during his career. Glen Taylor has been the majority owner of the Timberwolves since 1994. Taylor, 73, told The Associated Press in 2012 that he hoped to add a minority partner at some point who could succeed him as majority owner.  Flip Saunders, the team's coach and president of basketball operations, is also a minority owner and extremely close with Garnett, having helped mold him as his coach from Garnett's rookie season until 2005. "I have ties there. Flip's there," Garnett told Yahoo! Sports.
