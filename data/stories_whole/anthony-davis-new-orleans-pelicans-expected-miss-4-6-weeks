NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Pelicans say Anthony Davis is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks because of his broken left hand. The second-year big man and 2012 top overall draft choice was diagnosed with a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal of his left hand after Sunday night's victory over the Knicks in New York. The injury occurred during the first quarter in New York, when he hit his hand on the rim while going up for a contested lob. He underwent further evaluations by team doctors Tuesday in New Orleans before the club released the timetable for his return, which spans from 12 to 20 games. Davis started the Pelicans' first 16 games, averaging 18.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.6 blocks.
