CHICAGO -- The Bears signed five-time Pro Bowl safety Adrian Wilson to a one-year deal, the team announced Monday. Wilson spent 12 seasons with the Arizona Cardinals, for whom he started 162 games and recorded 885 tackles, 27 interceptions, 25Â½ sacks, 99 pass breakups and 15 forced fumbles. He is one of 13 players to register 20 or more interceptions and 20 or more sacks in their career since sacks became an official statistic in 1982. Arizona released Wilson on March 8, 2013, and the safety eventually signed a three-year contract with the New England Patriots. However, Wilson suffered a season-ending Achilles injury last summer and failed to play in a regular-season game in 2013. The Patriots released Wilson in April. The Bears' safety position is far from settled. The club signed Ryan Mundy to a two-year deal in free agency and drafted Brock Vereen in the fourth-round out of Minnesota after allowing former starter Major Wright to depart via free agency. Mundy and Vereen took the first-team reps in the Bears' recently completed veteran mandatory minicamp. Chris Conte, Craig Steltz, M.D. Jennings and Danny McCray are also in the hunt to earn roster spots at safety, but Conte and Steltz were sidelined for much of the offseason program due to injuries. Steltz is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, and it's unclear when Conte will be medically cleared to return from offseason shoulder surgery. The Bears also signed tight end Jeron Mastrud to a one-year contract Monday. Mastrud started 12 games for the Oakland Raiders last year and caught six passes for 88 yards. The 6-foot-6, 255-pound tight end played for the Miami Dolphins from 2010 to 2012.
