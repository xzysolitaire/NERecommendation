Quarterback Nick Foles is focused solely on executing the game plan and helping the Philadelphia Eagles win games. Nothing else matters, especially what type of gargantuan contracts other quarterbacks are signing. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick signed a six-year deal worth $110 million last week. The contract reportedly included a record $61 million in injury guarantees. According to the collective bargaining agreement, Foles isn't even eligible to sign an extension from his rookie year contract until after the 2014 season. "I think if you start worrying about numbers, you stop worrying about what you're doing," Foles told reporters Monday. "That's where you mess up. I'm happy for those guys who do well, but my most important thing is being successful with my teammates. When I'm playing out there, there's no dollar sign on me when I'm throwing a ball." Foles threw 27 touchdowns against only two interceptions last season. CSNPhilly.com noted that he will earn $615,000 this season. The only numbers Foles concerns himself with relate to the games. "I've always said how I play, how our team is, how I am as a leader -- that will all take care of that when the time comes," Foles said. "I'm really just having fun out here. I'm having fun with my teammates. I'm having fun playing the game." Kaepernick will have a chance to oppose Foles when the 49ers host the Eagles on Sept. 28. When the ball is kicked off, contracts won't matter. "I was just happy for him," Foles said about Kaepernick's deal. "He's played really well. I followed him in college when he was at Nevada and I thought he had a great college career, so I was just happy to see him be able to provide for his family and do great things."
