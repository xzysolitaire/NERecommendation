The Texas Rangers have granted interim manager Tim Bogar permission to speak with the Arizona Diamondbacks about their managerial opening. Bogar also will interview for the Rangers' job early next week, as will five others. "Tim is obviously a very strong candidate for our managerial position," Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said in a statement released Friday. "But we also understand that he has to look at all potential opportunities as we go through our process. He and I have had several extensive conversations in advance of the formal interview process he will have with other members of the organization next week." The other Rangers candidates include Jeff Banister, the Pittsburgh Pirates' bench coach; Kevin Cash, the Cleveland Indians' bullpen coach; Alex Cora, the manager/GM of the Caguas Criollos of the Puerto Rican winter league; Torey Lovullo, bench coach of the Boston Red Sox; and Joe McEwing, the Chicago White Sox's third base coach. Cora also is a baseball analyst for ESPN. There is no specific date for when the interviews will take place, but Daniels has said his objective is to get a manager hired by the end of October. The Rangers already have interviewed two candidates for the job: pitching coach Mike Maddux and Triple-A manager Steve Buechele.
