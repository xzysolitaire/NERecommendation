MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Bucks say their new court is ready to make its regular-season debut Wednesday night against Washington. NBA officials ruled the court unplayable in the Bucks' final exhibition game on Oct. 25 because players were slipping, and the game was canceled midway through the first period. The Bucks say the new court has been completely resurfaced to ensure player safety. The Bucks' court from last season was used for the first six home games of the regular season. The Bucks unveiled the new court design, inspired by artist Robert Indiana, at an event at the Milwaukee Art Museum in September.
