BOSTON -- Lawyers representing Aaron Hernandez in his two murder cases are continuing to challenge evidence seized from the former New England Patriots star's home last June. In a court filing Monday his lawyers argue that photos and videos appear to show a state trooper didn't actually have a copy of the search warrant and supporting affidavit when entering the home, as he recently testified. The attorneys say another officer appeared to be holding the warrant. The lawyers are asking a judge to approve a subpoena for news media copies of raw footage of the incident. Hernandez is charged with the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home. He is also charged with killing two men in a 2012 drive-by shooting in Boston. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.
