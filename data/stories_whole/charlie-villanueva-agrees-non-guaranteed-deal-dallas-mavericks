DALLAS -- Veteran power forward Charlie Villanueva has agreed to sign a non-guaranteed contract with the Dallas Mavericks, a source told ESPNDallas.com. The Mavs have 15 players with guaranteed contracts -- the league's limit for a regular-season roster -- so Villanueva will have a difficult time making the team. He is a candidate to serve as a reserve stretch power forward, a role player the Mavs did not have on the roster after voiding Rashard Lewis' one-year deal due to his need for knee surgery. The 6-foot-11, 240-pound Villanueva, 30, has averaged 11.5 points and 5.1 rebounds in nine NBA seasons. However, his production plummeted after signing a five-year, $38 million deal with the Detroit Pistons that expired last season. Villanueva averaged 4.6 points and 1.8 rebounds in 20 games last season.
