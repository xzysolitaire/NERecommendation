NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets forward Andrei KirilenkoÂ missed Friday night's 120-95 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder due to a sore right calf. "We'll see how he feels tomorrow," Nets coach Jason Kidd said. "It's not that we're concerned ... but we're going on the safer side of sitting him out tonight and seeing how he feels tomorrow." Kirilenko missed the last two practices as a result of the injury. He underwent an MRI on Thursday, which came back negative. Kirilenko has already missed 26 games this season due to back spasms -- including a stretch of 25 straight. Kirilenko's defensive prowess will be missed, given that the Nets are facing NBA leading scorer Kevin Durant (31.3 points per game). Durant has scored more than 30 points in 12 consecutive games, averaging 38 points on 54.4 percent shooting in that span. Kirilenko, 32, is averaging 5.8 points and 3.1 rebounds on 48.5 percent shooting in 17 games for the Nets. Kidd also said the Nets will go with the same starting lineup against OKC, meaning Deron Williams will come off the bench for the sixth consecutive game.
