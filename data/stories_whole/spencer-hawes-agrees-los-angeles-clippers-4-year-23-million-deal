LOS ANGELES -- Free agent center Spencer Hawes has agreed to join the Los Angeles Clippers next season, sources confirmed Friday. Hawes will sign a four-year, $23 million deal with the Clippers that will take up the team's midlevel exception unless it can complete a sign-and-trade deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers before July 10, sources said. Teams can't sign free agents until the NBA's moratorium on deals is lifted on that date. Signing a big man, especially one who could shoot from the outside, was a priority for the Clippers this offseason, and coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers targeted Hawes early. In fact, the Clippers looked into a deal for Hawes, 26, before the trade deadline this past season. Hawes averaged 13.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game last season with the Philadelphia 76ers and Cavaliers. Almost as important for the Clippers, Hawes hit better than 41 percent from 3-point range and nearly 45 percent while he was in Cleveland. Yahoo! Sports first reported the deal.
