The Pittsburgh Pirates made one-year, $15.3 million qualifying offers to catcher Russell Martin and left-hander Francisco Liriano before Monday's 5 p.m. ET deadline. The two players have until Nov. 10 to accept the offer. The Pirates ensure they will receive draft-pick compensation in next year's draft if the players decline the offer and sign elsewhere this offseason. In 2014, the 31-year-old Martin had an offensive season reminiscent of those at the beginning of his career, batting .290 with 11 home runs and 67 RBIs for the Pirates, while also setting a career best in on-base percentage (.402). He also led the majors by throwing out 37 attempted base-stealers and finished fourth overall with a caught-stealing percentage of 38.5 as he threw out 37 of the 59 base-runners attempting to steal with him behind the plate. In nine seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Pirates, he has hit .259 with 119 homers and 540 RBIs. Martin was paid $8.5 million in 2014. The 31-year-old Liriano finished 7-10 with a 3.38 ERA last season, his second with the Pirates. In 2013, he posted a career best in victories, finishing 16-8 record and 3.02 ERA after signing a one-year contract with a vesting option for 2014 with the Pirates that was delayed after Liriano injured his non-pitching arm over the holidays. Liriano, who was paid $6 million in 2014, has a career record of 76-72 and a 4.07 ERA in nine seasons with the Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox and Pirates.
