MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Love will miss Saturday's game against the Miami Heat as he continues to be away from the team following the death of his grandmother. Love, the league's leading rebounder, left the team Thursday and has been in Oregon with his family. Timberwolves coach Rick Adelman said Love is likely to return to Minnesota on Sunday and could be back in the lineup for Monday's game at Detroit. The Heat were also short-handed Saturday, with forward Michael Beasley sitting out with sore hamstring. Miami did have both Dwyane Wade and Chris Andersen back after both players missed Thursday's loss to Chicago. Wade had been dealing with flu-like symptoms and Andersen was away from the team for personal reasons. The Timberwolves started Luc Richard Mbah a Moute at power forward. Love has been averaging 23.7 points and an NBA-best 13.6 rebounds. Adelman anticipated the Wolves would have trouble replacing Love's scoring and second-chance points against the Heat, who boast one of the NBA's most efficient offenses despite being one of the league's worst rebounding teams.
