TORONTO -- Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Ontario Provincial Police say there was a report early Monday that a vehicle went through a drive-thru with open beer bottles visible. Police say officers located the vehicle at a home, where they arrested Valanciunas, alleging he was under the influence of alcohol while driving. The 21-year-old Valanciunas is in his second season with the playoff-bound Raptors. He is averaging 11 points and 8.6 rebounds a game. The Raptors say the team takes the matter very seriously and are disappointed Valanciunas "put himself in this situation." They says they are gathering information and will comment further "when appropriate."
