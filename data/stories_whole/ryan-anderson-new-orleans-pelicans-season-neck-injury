NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Pelicans say forward Ryan Anderson will miss the remainder of the season because of a herniated cervical disk that has sidelined him since early January. Anderson is scheduled to have neck surgery April 8 to repair the injury, which occurred when he collided with the Celtics' Gerald Wallace during a game in Boston on Jan. 3. The 6-foot-10 Pelicans forward, who had been averaging 19.8 points during the first two months of the season, had been undergoing routine evaluations for nearly three months in hopes he would heal adequately with rest and that surgery could be avoided. However, team officials say physicians monitoring Anderson have determined that surgery will provide the six-year veteran with the best chance of a full recovery.
