NEW YORK -- The NBA Board of Governors has approved several modifications to the league's instant replay system. The most notable change announced Thursday night allows officials to use replay only in the last two minutes of overtime. Last year, instant replay was available for use in the entire overtime period. Referees can also now review plays to determine if a clear-path foul is warranted even if they did not initially call a clear-path foul. Previously a clear-path foul had to be called for the play to be eligible for review. Referees also will be able to use replay to determine if a foul merits being upgraded to a flagrant foul. Last season, they could only use replay if a flagrant foul was called on the floor.
