NEW YORK -- Amar'e Stoudemire will return to the court Tuesday against Charlotte after sitting out Sunday's game against the Timberwolves. The Knicks are taking a precautionary approach with the 30-year-old Stoudemire. The medical staff has advised coach Mike Woodson to limit Stoudemire to 10 minutes per game, and the same applies for forward Kenyon Martin. Stoudemire has undergone three knee procedures in the last 12 months, while Martin is dealing with a lingering ankle injury, which he first suffered last April. Woodson plans to alternate Stoudemire and Martin on back-to-back sets and may even alternate them on a game-to-game basis. Stoudemire sat out Sunday after playing on Thursday night. "They're both going to get a schedule for the rest of the month in terms of how it's going to play out," Woodson said before Sunday's game. "When there's a couple of days in between, I have the right to play both of them." Stoudemire has said that his sporadic playing schedule makes it difficult to develop a rhythm on the court. He had five points on 2-for-3 shooting in 11 minutes in his season debut against Chicago. "Sure, it's tough for both of them," Woodson said of Martin and Stoudemire. "My hands are tied, too. When the medical people release these guys and say that their minutes are ready to go up, then I'll be the first one to give them more minutes. But right now I can't do it."
