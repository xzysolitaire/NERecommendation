Veteran broadcaster Craig Sager has been diagnosed with leukemia. The news was first tweeted by his son on Thursday and confirmed by Sager on Friday. Sager said in a statement, referring to TNT's coverage of the NBA playoffs: "My favorite time of year -- city to city, round by round, 40 games in 40 nights. A dramatic turn has matched me with acute myeloid leukemia. From the sidelines to being sidelined, 40 veins and 40 electrolytes." He added at the end: "Too bad, I had some probing questions for Pop (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich)." According to the tweet from his son, Sager started treatment on Friday.Â  Sager, who has spent nearly 20 years covering the NBA as a sideline reporter for Turner Sports and TNT, is known for the bold suits he wears during broadcasts. He has been broadcasting sports nationally since 1981, when he joined CNN.
