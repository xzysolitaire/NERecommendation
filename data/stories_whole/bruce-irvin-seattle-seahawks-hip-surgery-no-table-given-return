RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks outside linebacker Bruce Irvin underwent hip surgery on Monday, but no other details on the severity of the injury were released by the team. Irvin competed seemingly without any problems in the team's first OTA practice one week ago. No timetable was given for his possible return, but he tweeted this on Monday afternoon: On Sunday, Irvin sent out this tweet: Irvin, 26, will be entering his third NFL season. He was a surprising first-round draft pick by the Seahawks in 2012 as a defensive end out of West Virginia. He had eight sacks as a rookie, but the Seahawks moved him to outside linebacker last season. Irvin now is in a battle for one of the two outside linebacker starting spots with K.J. Wright and Malcolm Smith, the MVP of the Super Bowl.
