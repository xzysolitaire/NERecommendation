WALTHAM Mass. -- Boston Celtics assistant coach Walter McCarty was arraigned Thursday in Framingham District Court court on a larceny charge. McCarty, who played 10 seasons in the NBA, including eight with the Celtics, is accused of bouncing checks -- including one for $18,000 --- to a contractor putting in $39,000 worth of cabinets in his home, according to WCVB-TV. McCarty, 40, pleaded not guilty. A pretrial hearing was scheduled for Dec. 11. "This matter stems from ordering some kitchen cabinets for a home that my family and I are building," McCarty said in a statement released by the Celtics. "We hope to resolve the matter soon, but I simply cannot comment further while the case is pending." McCarty's lawyer, Glen Tagliamonte, called it an unfortunate misunderstanding and says it stems from the fact that McCarty was a victim of identity theft that compromised his bank account. He plans to file a motion to dismiss the charges.
