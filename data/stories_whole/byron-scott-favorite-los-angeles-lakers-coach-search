LOS ANGELES -- While the Lakers remain focused on Thursday's draft and the start of free agency July 1, sources tell ESPN.com that former star Byron Scott has emerged as the leading candidate for the head-coaching job after impressing in three interviews with the team. Talks with the former Nets and Cavaliers coach have not progressed to the contract stage, as the Lakers continue to weigh whether to hold off on hiring a coach before they make their pitches to free agents. The possibility of soliciting opinions of free agents before making a hire is a large part of the reason the Lakers have taken such a deliberate approach to their coaching search since Mike D'Antoni resigned after the season. Scott, former Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins, former Suns coach Alvin Gentry and former Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy have had formal interviews with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and vice president of player personnel Jim Buss. Gentry signed on to become the associate head coach for Steve Kerr in Golden State. Hollins remains in contention for the job after a strong interview, sources said. Hollins also has had conversations with the Houston Rockets about an associate head-coaching role under Kevin McHale.
