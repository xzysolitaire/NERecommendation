NEW YORK -- Dwyane WadeÂ is sitting out Miami's game at Brooklyn on Friday, leaving the Heat without three starters. Shane Battier (strained left quadriceps) and Mario Chalmers (strained right Achilles) remained out for Miami, with coach Erik Spoelstra saying they were getting better but the team was being cautious. Although Wade did play in back-to-back games last week, he and the Heat's training staff decided he wouldn't this time after he felt some soreness in his knees from playing 39 minutes Thursday night in a loss at the New York Knicks. It's the ninth game this season Wade has missed. Ray Allen, Norris Cole and Rashard Lewis started alongside LeBron James and Chris Bosh.
