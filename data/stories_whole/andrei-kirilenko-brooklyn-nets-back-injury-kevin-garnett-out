NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets forward Andrei Kirilenko will return to the lineup on Friday night against the Detroit Pistons following a six-game absence due to a sprained left ankle. Center Kevin Garnett, on the other hand, will miss his 19th straight game due to back spasms. Nets coach Jason Kidd said Garnett will work out on Friday to see if he can play Saturday night in Philadelphia. Garnett has been targeting either this weekend, April 8 in Miami or April 9 in Orlando to make his return. Kirilenko said he and Garnett went through a 1-on-1 contact practice on Thursday. "It was good," Kirilenko said. "I think (Kevin's) getting better and better." Kirilenko doesn't know if there will be a minutes restriction on him, but he figures it's likely. Injuries have limited Kirilenko to just 37 games this season.Â Kirilenko, 33, is averaging 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds. The Nets have gone 13-5 without Garnett, but certainly could use him back. They are 3-3 in their last six games, and have allowed an average of 107.7 points per 100 possessions over that span. When the 37-year-old Garnett is on the court, the Nets allow 100.6 points per 100 possessions.
