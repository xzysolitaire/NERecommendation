With the first month of the season in the books, it's time for another game of fun with numbers, this time focusing on recent trends and splits for the month of November. 3.5 -- 3-point field goal attempts per game for John Wall on the season, up from just 0.9 per game last season. Not only is Wall taking more 3-point shots, but he's also hitting them at a much better clip (33.3 percent after 17 contests). Already a borderline elite fantasy player, adding 1.2 3-pointers to his 19.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, 9.0 assists and 2.4 steals per game makes Wall a top-10 fantasy player. 5.5 -- Shot attempts per game for Eric Bledsoe within five feet of the basket. Not only is Bledsoe getting to the rim whenever he wants, but he's also finishing at an incredibly high rate (65 percent on such attempts). Bledsoe ranks 12th on our Player Rater when sorted by averages after the first month thanks to averaging 19.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.1 3-pointers while shooting 50.7 percent from the floor and 80.6 percent from the line. There may still be a buy-low opportunity if his current owner soured on him after a shin injury forced him to miss six games late in the month. 7.3 -- Shot attempts per game for LaMarcus Aldridge from 15-19 feet away from the basket. He is shooting just 42.7 percent from that distance on the season. Aldridge is having a fantastic season, averaging 22.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks, but is shooting an uncharacteristic 45.2 percent from the floor -- which is well below his career average of 49.1 percent. Aldridge has slowly but surely taken his offensive game farther away from the basket in recent seasons, and while he will continue to be a great fantasy player, he may not be as efficient as he's been in previous seasons. No. 1 -- Anthony Davis' Player Rater rank when sorted by averages after the first month of the season. Unfortunately, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand during Sunday's game against the Knicks and will be out indefinitely. Ryan Anderson will likely step into his starting role. 27.6 -- Minutes per game for both Miami's Chris Bosh and San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard after the first month of action. Bosh is still fairly productive with 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks while shooting 52.1 percent from the floor and 80.6 percent from the line, but the lack of minutes are really killing his upside in Miami. Leonard, meanwhile, has averaged 11.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 0.6 3-pointers per game thus far. The steals are nice, but his numbers are a far cry from what many were expecting this season. Both Bosh and Leonard will remain quality fantasy players, but will have a hard time meeting expectations unless their minutes increase. 35.8 -- Ricky Rubio's field goal percentage after 18 contests. Rubio has basically turned into a reverse Rajon Rondo-type of fantasy player (flip their field goal and free throw percentages), one who is dominant in assists (8.6) and steals (3.0) but leaves a lot to be desired in terms of efficiency and scoring. Rubio is still an extremely valuable fantasy player, but the lack of scoring has become frustrating at times. Rondo, meanwhile, is close to returning from knee surgery and should be added in all leagues if he's still available. 6.3 -- Free throw attempts per game for Timberwolves shooting guard Kevin Martin. He is connecting on 93.5 percent of his free throw attempts, and is averaging a cool 23.1 points, 1.1 steals and 2.4 3-pointers per game in Minnesota. Despite his lack of rebounds (3.8) and assists (2.3), Martin ranks 21st on our Player Rater thanks to his 3-point shooting and free throw percentage. 2.2 -- Free throw attempts per game for Pistons center Andre Drummond, who shoots a dismal 28.6 percent from the line. Perhaps Drummond should follow Tristan Thompson's lead and start shooting with his off hand? Despite Drummond's struggles from the line, he ranks 56th on our Player Rater simply because he doesn't get to the line enough for the poor percentage to hurt us that much. The rest of his numbers -- 12.0 points, 11.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.2 blocks per game -- are simply fantastic. 3.2 -- Steals plus 3-pointers per game for Wolves small forward Corey Brewer. Averaging 14.3 points, 1.9 steals and 1.3 3-pointers while shooting 47.3 percent from the floor, Brewer has been incredibly undervalued in fantasy leagues to date. Get him now if he's still available in your league. 49.5 -- Field goal percentage for Detroit shooting guard Rodney Stuckey, who looks great as a sixth man in the Pistons' backcourt. Stuckey has always had talent but previously struggled to find his niche as he switched between point guard and shooting guard over his first six seasons. It is clear that Stuckey fits much better alongside a true point guard like Brandon Jennings as a sixth man off the bench. 2.92 -- Steals per 48 minutes for Orlando rookie Victor Oladipo. With averages of 14.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and 0.8 3-pointers over his past five games, Oladipo is well on his way to breaking out. It's only a matter of time before he's earning 30-35 minutes per game on a regular basis for the Magic, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him finishing in the top 50 on the Player Rater when all is said and done. 18.6 -- Rebounds per 48 minutes for Jordan Hill, which is the best in the league (yes, even better than Kevin Love's 18.3 rebounds per 48 minutes). Hill recently has struggled with an ankle injury, but has still averaged 11.6 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.2 blocks over his past 10 contests. With his energy and ability to bring down tough rebounds in traffic, Hill should remain a big part of the Lakers' plans going forward.
