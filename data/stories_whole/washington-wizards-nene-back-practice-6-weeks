WASHINGTON -- Washington Wizards forward Nene has returned to practice after being sidelined six weeks with a sprained knee. Nene practiced Monday for the first time since he was injured Feb. 23 in a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Coach Randy Wittman said Nene did "almost" everything the Brazilian would do in a regular practice. The coach said he would wait to see how things go on Tuesday before deciding whether Nene plays Wednesday against the Charlotte Bobcats, a pivotal game for playoff seeding in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards have typically struggled in the past when Nene has been hurt, but they managed to go 12-9 without him and clinch the team's first playoff berth since 2008.
