GRAPEVINE, Texas -- If Josh Brent decides he wants to play football again, the Dallas Cowboys would have interest in bringing back the defensive tackle. Last January, Brent was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years probation for a drunk-driving accident in December 2012 that killed Jerry Brown, his best friend and teammate. Brent is scheduled to be released from jail before the Cowboys open training camp in Oxnard, Calif., on July 22. "The league will have a big say in when he can come back, but we'll certainly evaluate that situation when it comes," executive vice president Stephen Jones said at the Cowboys' annual sponsors' golf tournament. "I certainly wouldn't rule it out." Brent abruptly retired last July before his trial. He had been on the Cowboys' roster since the accident but did not take part in any of the offseason program. The league could further sanction Brent under the personal conduct policy. The team has been in contact with the league but a decision has not been made. It is possible he could face a suspension, fine or both. Brent would have to file for reinstatement before he can play for any team. The Cowboys hold his rights. "It's a work in progress," Jones said. "Obviously they're looking at it and we'll kind of see how it goes. Obviously he sat out a year and the bigger thing is Josh has got to see where his priorities are. There's a lot of things that have got to be determined there." The Cowboys have signed five defensive linemen in free agency and added three in the draft. Brent has not played in a game since Dec. 2, 2012.
