NEW YORK -- The NBA Development League has added a team in the New York suburb of White Plains that will be owned and operated by the Knicks. The addition of the team brings the D-League membership to 18 teams, seven of them owned and operated by an NBA franchise. Allan Houston, the Knicks' assistant general manager, will serve as the new team's GM. Houston calls the D-League "thriving, and this opportunity allows us to develop players closer to our training facility, and to provide high level, affordable basketball entertainment to the community." The team will conduct a fan vote to help choose the name of the new D-League club. It will play 24 regular-season games at the County Center.
