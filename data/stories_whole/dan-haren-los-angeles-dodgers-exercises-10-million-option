LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers pitcher Dan Haren on Thursday exercised his $10 million player option for next season. The right-hander was 13-11 with a 4.02 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. Last month, Haren guaranteed the option for the big payday by going seven innings in a loss to the San Francisco Giants, who won the World Series. "I've pitched good enough to deserve that," he said at the time. "It's a ton of money." At that point in September, he wasn't sure whether he would return next year. Last week, the 34-year-old pitcher had arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder to clean out bursitis and the AC joint. The team said he is expected to be ready by spring training.
