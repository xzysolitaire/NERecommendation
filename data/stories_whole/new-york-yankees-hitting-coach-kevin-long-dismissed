NEW YORK -- After a disappointing season in which their offense underperformed and their defense was often shoddy, the Yankees have dismissed their hitting coach, Kevin Long, and their infield/first base coach, Mick Kelleher. Long, who served in the capacity since 2007, was among the most well-respected hitting coaches in the game but in 2014 the Yankees' offense struggled, scoring just 633 runs, fewer than all but two American League teams, and the team batting average was just .245, 12th in the league despite the signings of free agents Jacoby Ellsbury, Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann. Kelleher, a former major-league infielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers and Angels, had been a member of manager Joe Girardi's staff since 2009.
