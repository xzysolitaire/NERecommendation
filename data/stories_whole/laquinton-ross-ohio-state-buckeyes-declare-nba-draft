Ohio State junior forward LaQuinton Ross will declare for the NBA Draft, sources told ESPN. The 6-foot-8 Mississippi native averaged 15.2 points and 5.9 rebounds for the Buckeyes this past season. Sources said Ross with Buckeyes coach Thad Matta on Monday afternoon to inform him of his decision. Ross helped take Ohio State to the NCAA tournament, where the Buckeyes lost to Dayton in the second round. Ross is considered a fringe first-round pick. A year ago, Ohio State's Deshaun Thomas left after his junior campaign and wound up being selected in the second round.
