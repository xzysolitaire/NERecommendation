EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett will not play in Boston on Wednesday night against the Celtics, Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd said Saturday. "As of right now, those two won't play in Boston," Kidd said. "They'll play in the final (preseason) game (in Miami on Friday)." Pierce said he probably wouldn't travel to Boston, though Kidd said he hasn't talked with Pierce or Garnett about travel. Pierce played the first 15 seasons of his career in Boston before being traded to the Nets along with Garnett and Jason Terry in the offseason. "I'd rather do it once than twice," Pierce said of making his return to Boston. The Nets visit the Celtics for the first time in the regular season on Jan. 26. Pierce said he's not exactly looking forward to playing in Boston because he knows it'll be emotional and expects to shed a tear or two.
