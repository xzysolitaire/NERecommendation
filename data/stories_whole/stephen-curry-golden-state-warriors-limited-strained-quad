OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry says he will play limited minutes for the foreseeable future because of a strained right quad. Curry said before the Warriors hosted the Suns on Sunday night that an MRI on his quad revealed the strain. He said he injured his quad during Golden State's win at Boston on Wednesday and began to feel pain again during Friday's victory over Atlanta. "It was getting kind of worse and worse, especially if I sat down for an extended period of time, it got a little stiff," Curry said. "It's tolerable. There's just a potential for when that muscle fatigues for other things to creep up, and that's what we're trying to avoid." Warriors coach Mark Jackson said there's no set limit on the All-Star point guard's minutes. Both said they will communicate with each other during games to determine when -- and how much -- Curry plays. Curry, who has had two surgeries on his right ankle, said he has not dealt with a quad injury before. But he believes he can play through the pain while the muscle heals without doing further damage. Curry was in the starting lineup Sunday night and was expected to defend Phoenix's Goran Dragic, who had 34 points and 10 assists in the Suns' win over the Warriors on Feb. 8. "I would imagine if I was him and Dragic scored 10 points, I would say I was fine," Jackson joked. "If Dragic scored 30, I would say (the quad) was kind of tight."
