Boston Celtics shooting guard Avery Bradley will return to game action Friday night against the Phoenix Suns, according to the team. Bradley has missed 19 of the team's past 22 games due to a right ankle sprain suffered in late January. He initially sat out five games, then aggravated the injury by returning too soon. He has not played since Feb. 9, sitting out 13 games. He participated in the team's morning shootaround and coach Brad Stevens said during his weekly appearance on Boston sports radio 98.5 the Sports Hub that Bradley would play. The 23-year-old Bradley has put together a quality season, averaging career bests of 14.3 points and 3.9 rebounds over 30.6 minutes per game. He's in line to become a restricted free agent after the season.
