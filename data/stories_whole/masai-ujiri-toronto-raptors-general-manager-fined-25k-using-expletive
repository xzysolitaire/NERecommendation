Toronto Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the expletive he uttered Saturday at a pep rally before the Raptors' home playoff opener. Earlier, sources with knowledge of the league's ruling told ESPN.com that Ujiri received a formal warning but would not be fined after separate conversations Monday with NBA commissioner Adam Silver and president of basketball operations Rod Thorn. Sources told ESPN.com that league officials then reconsidered and opted for the fine, marking the second time this month that a disciplinary decision has been revised. The Dallas Mavericks were originally told that public-address announcer Sean Heath would be suspended for tweets critical of the officiating in a late-season home loss to Golden State before the penalty was reduced to a $25,000 fine. Ujiri shouted "F--- Brooklyn!" at a fan rally outside Air Canada Centre prior to Game 1 of his team's first-round Eastern Conference playoff series Saturday against the Nets -- a 94-87 Brooklyn victory. Ujiri's use of the expletive was captured by a fan and posted on Instagram. Ujiri apologized later Saturday during a brief session with reporters at halftime. "Wrong choice of words out there," he said. "It is really not about me. It is about the players and the playoffs. "Just trying to get the crowd out there rattled -- wrong choice of words. I apologize to kids out there and to the Brooklyn guys. Nothing against them. Just trying to get our fans going. That's it." Ujiri, who did not answer any questions during the session, reiterated that he does not like the Nets. "You know how I feel," he said with a chuckle. "Thanks guys. I apologize for not taking any questions, but you know how I feel. I don't like 'em. I apologize."
