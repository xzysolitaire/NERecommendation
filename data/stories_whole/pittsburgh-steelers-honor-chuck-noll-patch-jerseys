PITTSBURGH -- The Steelers plan to wear a patch on their jerseys this season in memory of iconic coach Chuck Noll, according to a source. Noll died last Friday night at the age of 82. The organization is in the process of deciding how best to honor Noll, and the Steelers recently announced plans to wear a patch that commemorates their first Super Bowl victory for their Nov. 30 game against the visiting New Orleans Saints. This marks the 40th year since the Steelers beat the Minnesota Vikings, 16-6, in Super Bowl IX. That victory, which took place in New Orleans, started a run in which the Steelers won four Super Bowls in six seasons. Noll, the only coach to win four Super Bowls, was laid to rest Tuesday following a funeral at St. Paul's Cathedral Church in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Team president Art Rooney II and former Steelers great Joe Greene were among those who served as pallbearers, and the funeral was attended by scores of former Steelers who played for Noll. A handful of current players, including quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, cornerback Ike Taylor, center Maurkice Pouncey and defensive end Cameron Heyward represented the Steelers at Noll's service. "I may not have known him personally but reputation and the way he went about things speaks for itself. I felt it was only right for me to pay tribute," Heyward said. "Without him, I wouldn't get a chance to look up to Joe Greene. I really appreciate what he did for this game, and just as a human being you see the way he was loved and you just appreciate it. The standard was set by him." Troy Polamalu, who met Noll one time early in his career, agreed. "There is no Steelers legacy without him," the eight-time Pro Bowl safety said. "He's as big a part of this organization as the Rooneys are. He definitely embodied a certain aura about him that was very special."
