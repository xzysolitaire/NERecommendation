HOUSTON -- Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili are being held out by the San Antonio Spurs against the undefeated Houston Rockets. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich says both veterans will be rested Thursday night. The pair played 35 and 26 minutes, respectively, Wednesday night in a 94-92 win over Atlanta. Aron Baynes and Matt Bonner will start in their places. Also missing for the defending NBA champions will be forwards Marco Belinelli (mild right groin strain) and Tiago Splitter (right calf tightness). Belinelli played five minutes against the Hawks. Houston will be without Patrick Beverley (strained hamstring), who played 30 minutes in Tuesday night's 108-91 victory over Miami. It will mark the third game Beverley has missed due to injury this season. Isaiah Canaan will start in his place.
