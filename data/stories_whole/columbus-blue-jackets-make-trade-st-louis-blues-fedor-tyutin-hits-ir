The Columbus Blue Jackets have acquired veteran defenseman Jordan Leopold from the St. Louis Blues in an effort to shore up their defensive corps after announcing Saturday that Fedor Tyutin will miss the next four to six weeks with a knee sprain. Tyutin, who was placed on injured reserve, sprained the knee Friday in Philadelphia. He has two assists in 16 games this season. The Blue Jackets sent a 2016 fifth-round pick back to St. Louis. The Blues retained $500,000 (pro-rated) from Leopold's $2.25 million salary, so the Blue Jackets get him at a $1.75 million cap hit, a source told ESPN.com's Pierre LeBrun. "We want to thank Jordan for his hard work and dedication while in St. Louis," said Blues general manager Doug Armstrong. "Jordan is a true professional, and we wish him and his family the best of luck in the future." Coming off IR for Columbus on Saturday was center Artem Anisimov, who had missed the last seven games due to an upper-body injury. St. Louis recalled defenseman Chris Butler from AHL Chicago.
