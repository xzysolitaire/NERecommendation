Miami Marlins third baseman Casey McGehee and Seattle Mariners pitcher Chris Young are the National and American League comeback players of the year, Major League Baseball announced Friday. In his first year with the Marlins following a season in Japan with the Rakuten Golden Eagles, the 32-year-old McGehee batted .287 with 29 doubles, four home runs and 76 RBIs. His 177 hits ranked fourth in the NL and set a career high. Young went 12-9 with a 3.65 ERA over 30 games (29 starts) in his first year with Seattle following an injury-plagued 2013 season in which he made nine minor league starts. The 35-year-old right-hander recorded double-digit wins for the first time since 2006, and his 165 innings pitched were his third most in a season. The awards were voted on by the 30 beat writers from MLB.com, who each selected one candidate in each league.
