Billionaire Antony Ressler is preparing a bid to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers, according to the New York Post. The NBA has charged Donald Sterling with damaging the league with his racist comments and set a hearing for June 3, after which other team owners will vote to decide the future of his ownership of the Clippers. Ressler, 54, is "going to be aggressive" about making a bid, according to the report, which cited sources. He also made a bid to purchase the Los Angeles Dodgers. Other notables said to have interest in purchasing the Clippers include: Larry Ellison, who could partner with David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey; former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer; and Magic Johnson along with executives at Guggenheim Partners, who teamed up to buy the Dodgers.
