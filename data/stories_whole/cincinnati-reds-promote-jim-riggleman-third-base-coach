CINCINNATI -- The Reds promoted Jim Riggleman to third base coach on Monday, replacing Steve Smith. It's the only change on Cincinnati's coaching staff following an 86-loss season that was their worst since 2008. Riggleman joined the Reds in 2012 as manager of their Double-A team. He managed Triple-A Louisville the last two years. The 62-year-old Riggleman has been a coach or manager in the majors since 1981. He managed the Padres from 1992-94, the Cubs from 1995-99, the Mariners in 2008 and the Nationals from 2009-11. Cincinnati is entering its second year under manager Bryan Price, who took over when Dusty Baker was fired after making the playoffs in three of the four previous seasons.
