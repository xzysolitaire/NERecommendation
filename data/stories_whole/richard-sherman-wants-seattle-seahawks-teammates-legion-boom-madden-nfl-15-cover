Richard Sherman evidently wants to share the "Madden NFL 15" spotlight with his Seattle Seahawks teammates. Sherman, who was voted as the cover athlete for the popular video game, said he has lobbied EA Sports to include the rest of Seattle's "Legion of Boom" secondary on the cover. "I've been trying to get the Legion of Boom on the cover, and EA has been fighting me," Sherman told reporters Monday at the Seahawks' OTA. "So if everybody wants to start a petition to get the Legion of Boom on the cover, here it is, here's an open invitation." Sherman and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton were the finalists in the "Madden NFL 15" online voting, which concluded Friday on ESPN.com. Widely regarded as the best cornerback in the NFL, the 26-year-old Sherman said Friday that he "would never be in the position" to be on the cover without the rest of Seattle's outstanding secondary, which features Pro Bowl safeties Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor and emerging cornerback Byron Maxwell. Sherman reiterated his appreciation for the cover vote Monday, referring to it as an honor. "It was cool. It was really cool," Sherman said. "It was a great experience. It's always an honor being picked for 'Madden.' It's a fun deal." Sherman is only the third defensive player to make the "Madden" cover, joining Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis for the 2005 edition and Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, who shared the 2010 cover with Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.
