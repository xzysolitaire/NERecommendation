October will be all about big reveals for LeBron James both on and off the court. In addition to teaming up with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving for the first time with the Cleveland Cavaliers, James has produced two television shows that are set to debut. The shows, while both inspired by James' personal experiences, are intended for vastly different audiences. "Becoming," which will debut Oct. 26 on Disney XD, is geared toward children and families and will chronicle the lives of prominent athletes before they were stars. "I'm really excited about helping develop 'Becoming' and bringing this kind of program to kids," James said in a statement. "Sports and athletes were my inspiration growing up. It was the stories about Michael Jordan, Deion Sanders, and Allen Iverson that kept me dreaming. When I learned that they had some of the same struggles and challenges I did, it made everything seem possible. That's what 'Becoming' is all about." James and longtime friend and business partner Maverick Carter are executive producers of the half-hour show, created along with ESPN Films and James' Springhill Productions. The pilot episode will focus on James' upbringing. "It is incredibly exciting to use our style of non-fiction storytelling to showcase LeBron's extraordinary story," Connor Schell, vice president and executive producer of ESPN Films, said in a statement. "For an audience of kids everywhere, the tone of the show is meant to be aspirational and illustrate how much support and hard work goes into LeBron becoming who he is today." James' other TV show, "Survivor's Remorse," will debut Saturday on STARZ. It's a comedy that centers around Cam Calloway -- a fictional pro basketball star -- and his friends and family as he tries to navigate the challenges that come with fame and success. James and Carter are producers of the show, intended for adult audiences, along with former "Cosby Show" producer and current Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner.
