OKLAHOMA CITY -- Police say the home of Oklahoma City Thunder guard Andre Roberson was recently burglarized while he was at practice. A Thunder spokesman said the 6-foot-7 rookie from Colorado attended the team's practice at 10 a.m. on April 21. A police report shows Roberson said he left his Edmond, Oklahoma, home at 9 a.m. that day and returned at 12:30 p.m. to find that a window screen had been pried off and a sliding glass door had a broken frame. According to the report, an Xbox worth $400 and a backpack worth $50 were stolen. On April 28, Indiana Pacers forward Paul George's platinum 2014 All-Star ring with diamonds, valued at $15,000, was stolen from his Indianapolis home, along with a watch valued at $700.
