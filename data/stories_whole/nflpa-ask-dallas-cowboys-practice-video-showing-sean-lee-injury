After interviewing Dallas Cowboys players, the NFL Players Association has decided not to request the videotape of the non-contact practice last week in which middle linebacker Sean Lee suffered a season-ending knee injury, league sources said. Requesting the practice tape would be tantamount to making an accusation that the Cowboys were not complying with rules in the CBA regulating offseason practices. The union scrutinized public video of Lee, who appeared to slip and tear his left ACL just before a collision with rookie offensive lineman Zack Martin. The Cowboys believe the injury occurred before the contact. The union also looked at the question of whether the apparent high tempo of the practice at that point was evident throughout the session or isolated to that play. Lee suffered a torn ACL and a slight tear in his meniscus on the play, the latest injuries to the highly productive yet oft-injured linebacker.
