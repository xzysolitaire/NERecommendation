CLEVELAND -- New York Knicks point guard Jose Calderon will miss two to three weeks because of a right calf strain, the team announced Thursday. An MRI revealed the injury. Shane Larkin will likely start in Calderon's absence Thursday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Calderon's injury leaves the Knicks thin at point guard. Pablo Prigioni, 37, and Larkin, a second-year guard, are the only two true point guards on the roster. The Knicks may ask combo guard Iman Shumpert to handle the ball with Calderon out or may seek to add a point guard in free agency. New York penciled Calderon into its starting lineup 90 minutes before tipoff of its season opener Wednesday. But the veteran was a late scratch because he aggravated the calf injury during warm-ups. Calderon had been hobbled by the injury late in the preseason, missing the Knicks' final two exhibition games. Larkin started at point guard alongside Shumpert in the New York backcourt against Chicago. He finished with six points and three assists in 26 minutes in the Knicks' 24-point loss. Calderon's absence comes at an inopportune time for New York (0-1). The Knicks face a tough group of point guards in their next three games: Cleveland's Kyrie Irving, Charlotte's Kemba Walker and Washington's John Wall.
