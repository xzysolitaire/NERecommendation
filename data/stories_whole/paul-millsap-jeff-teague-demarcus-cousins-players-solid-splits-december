With another month of the season in the books, it's time for another game of fun with numbers, this time focusing on recent trends and splits for the month of December. 9.7: Free throw attempts per game for DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins has been ultra aggressive on the offensive end with 23.8 points, 12.3 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.1 steals and 0.8 blocks while shooting 52.1 percent from the floor and 73.3 percent from the line over the past month. He has been a top-10 value for a little more than a month now, and he should be treated like a first-round talent in trade negotiations. 5.2: Offensive rebounds per game for Nikola Pekovic in 13 games during the month of December. Only Andre Drummond (6.0) had more offensive rebounds per game last month. Pekovic's prowess on the offensive glass is the primary reason for his 20.7 points, 9.8 rebounds and 51.2 percent shooting from the floor over the past month. Pek would be ranked much higher if he contributed more in steals (0.5) or blocks (0.4). 52.7: Field goal percentage in 15.5 shot attempts per game for Thaddeus Young. Young bounced back from a mediocre November to post 20.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 0.7 blocks and 1.3 3-pointers while shooting 52.7 percent from the floor and 82.1 percent from the line in 13 games in December. This is exactly the kind of production many of us were expecting when we predicted a breakout season from Young at the start of the season. 18.4: Rebounds per 48 minutes for Miles Plumlee in 13 games during the month of December. Plumlee averaged close to a double-double with 1.7 blocks in just 25.8 minutes per game last month. With production like that, it was surprising to see him bouncing between the most added/most dropped list over the past few weeks. Granted, Plumlee would be more valuable if he shot better from the free throw line, or if he were more consistent on a nightly basis, but he should still be owned in all fantasy leagues at this point. 8.2: Assists per game for Atlanta Hawks point guard Jeff Teague, who is coming on strong and will be even more valuable with Al Horford out for the year. Teague averaged 16.6 points, 8.2 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 3-pointers last month and figures to be a top-30 player for the remainder of the season. 4.5: Steals plus blocks plus 3-pointers per game for Paul Millsap in 14 December games. Millsap averaged 20.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.3 blocks and 1.6 3-pointers last month. He'll probably come back down to earth in the 3-point shooting department, but the rest of his numbers are absolutely legit, particularly now that Al Horford is out for the year. He's a good bet to return top-20 value the rest of the way. 6.5: 3-point field goal attempts per game for Jameer Nelson in 13 games last month. Nelson has been extremely underrated this season, despite posting 14.0 points, 6.2 assists, 1.3 steals and 2.6 3-pointers in December. I still have some doubts on Nelson's long-term value given his injury history and the presence of Victor Oladipo in the Orlando Magic backcourt, so there is definitely a little sell high opportunity here. 16.2: Field goal attempts per game for Bucks point guard Brandon Knight in 15 games during the month of December. Knight was brilliant last month with 18.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.7 3-pointers in 32.7 minutes per game. I still have a hard time trusting anyone in Milwaukee, but Knight has been fantastic for more than a month now and appears to be a safe investment the rest of the way. 14.0: Rebounds per game for DeAndre Jordan, best in the league in the month of December. Jordan might be shooting 38.9 percent from the free throw line with just 8.1 points per game over the past month, but he's really getting it done on the defensive end with 14.0 rebounds and 1.0 steals and 2.3 blocks per game during that span. For all of his faults, Jordan is actually providing top-50 value in fantasy leagues according to our Player Rater. 27.7: Minutes per game for Milwaukee Bucks rookie Giannis Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo posted a modest 8.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 0.7 steals and 1.1 blocks per game, but has shown plenty of promise and upside in the process. Look for the 7-26 Bucks to continue to give him more run as they fall deeper and deeper into the basement in the Eastern Conference. 5.8: 3-point field goal attempts per game for Terrence Ross in 12 starts on the season. Ross is averaging 14.0 points, 0.9 steals and 2.8 3-pointers as a starter this season, and is currently owned in just 25.6 percent of ESPN.com leagues. He's mostly going to be a scoring and 3-point specialist, but is a player who should be owned in most fantasy formats. 7: Double-doubles for J.J. Hickson in 15 games in the month of December. Hickson finished the month with 11.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 0.7 steals and 0.6 blocks in just 26.2 minutes per game. The lack of blocks and poor free throw shooting limits his upside, but Hickson has played well enough to earn more minutes in the Denver frontcourt. Do not be surprised if his minutes per game creep above the 30 per night mark as we move deeper into the season.
