LOS ANGELES -- Beverly Hills police were called to the home of Donald Sterling after his estranged wife, Shelly, reported a burglary, but found no crime. Instead, officers found Sterling hosting V. Stiviano -- the woman whose recordings of him making racist remarks led to his removal as owner of the Los Angeles Clippers and a lifetime ban from the NBA. Lt. Lincoln Hoshino said officers were called to the home by Shelly Sterling at 1:40 p.m. PT Wednesday and were there for roughly 15 minutes. Hoshino said they found "no criminal activity whatsoever" and Stiviano was Donald Sterling's invited guest. In March, Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, seeking the return of more than $2.5 million in gifts Stiviano allegedly received from Donald Sterling. Shelly Sterling's attorney said he had no knowledge of the incident.
