DETROIT -- The San Francisco Giants got a congratulatory call from Air Force One for their World Series victory. President Barack Obama placed the call Saturday to Giants manager Bruce Bochy on a flight from Washington to Detroit for a midterm campaign rally. Obama spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman says the president told Bochy he looks forward to welcoming the team to the White House for a championship visit. And she says Obama sent congratulations to Madison Bumgarner on being named World Series MVP. Bumgarner pitched five shutout innings to lead the Giants to a 3-2 win in Game 7 at Kansas City on Wednesday night.
