DENVER -- Nuggets guard Nate Robinson has had surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. Team physician Dr. Steve Traina performed the surgery Friday. Robinson was injured in a spill underneath the Nuggets' basket during the first quarter of Wednesday night's loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. The team announced Robinson had the surgery during the second quarter of their 100-90 loss to the Toronto Raptors. Robinson became a key performer off the bench after signing with Denver as a free agent last summer. He averaged 10.4 points and 2.5 assists in 44 games this season. The loss of Robinson left Denver without its top two point guards. Robinson was hurt while starting in place of the injured Ty Lawson, who missed his second consecutive game Friday with a left rotator cuff strain.
