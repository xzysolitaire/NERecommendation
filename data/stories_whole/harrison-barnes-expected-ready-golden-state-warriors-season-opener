Golden State Warriors forward Harrison Barnes, who has been sidelined by a foot injury for the past two weeks, is expected to be ready for next week's regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Barnes has not played since Oct. 7 because of inflammation in his left foot.Â  "I don't think it's too much of a concern, right now, of him not playing opening night," Warriors coach Mark Jackson told reporters, according to CSNBayArea.com. "We have some time left." Barnes, 21, did not participate in the Warriors' team practice Monday, but he did practice shooting at the team's facility. "We're taking steps toward him getting on the floor," Jackson said. "Today, it's shooting the basketball. We'll see how his body responds and we'll make a decision moving forward." The 6-foot-8 Barnes averaged 9.2 points and 4.1 rebounds as a rookie last season. He was a key contributor during Golden State's postseason run, averaging 16.1 points and 6.4 rebounds in 12 games as the Warriors reached the second round before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in six games.
