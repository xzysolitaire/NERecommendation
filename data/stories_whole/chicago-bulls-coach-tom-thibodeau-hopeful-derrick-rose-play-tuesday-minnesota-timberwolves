CHICAGO -- Bulls point guard Derrick Rose participated in Monday's practice and coach Tom Thibodeau is hopeful his star point guard will be able to play Tuesday night against the Orlando Magic after missing Saturday's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves because of two sprained ankles. "We'll see [Tuesday]," Thibodeau said. "He's better today than he was [Sunday]." Rose sprained both his ankles in Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers and did not play on Saturday as a precaution. Rose and the Bulls' front office both want to take a cautious approach as the former league MVP makes his way back from two serious knee injuries. Rose warmed up with his teammates on Saturday and was listed in the first starting lineup, but ultimately decided not to play. "We're going by where he is, how he's feeling," Thibodeau said. "When you think back with Team USA he did five games in six days and he didn't have any problems. He did nine [games] in 16 [days]. If he's feeling good, great. And if he needs time, then we're going to give him time. It's really that simple." Bulls power forward Taj Gibson was also back at practice Monday after missing Saturday's game because of a sprained left ankle. He is optimistic about playing against the Magic, as well. "It's feeling a little better," Gibson said. "I feel like I should be able to go [Tuesday], you never know, we'll see, it's still being evaluated, but it looked good today in practice."
