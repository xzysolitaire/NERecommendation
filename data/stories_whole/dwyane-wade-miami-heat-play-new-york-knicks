MIAMI --Â LeBron James will play without his co-pilot for the sixth straight game when the Miami Heat take on the New York Knicks on Sunday. Heat guard Dwyane Wade will be held out with a lingering hamstring issue, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Sunday morning. Wade will be joined on the bench by centers Greg Oden (back spasms) and Chris Andersen, who is dealing with various ailments. This marks the 25th game that Wade has missed this season, but the Heat have survived without him. After starting out 5-6 in games without Wade, the Heat have now won 11 of their last 13 games without their All-Star. Wade worked out Saturday and plans to put some work in on Sunday after he has dealt with various leg issues involving his Achilles, groin and hamstring in addition to his troublesome knee issues all season-long. The Heat have seven games remaining in the regular season and have a one-game lead over the Indiana Pacers in the loss column for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. Sunday's game against the Knicks kicks off a tough week of games for the Heat, who face the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, Memphis Grizzlies on the road on Wednesday and then back in Miami for a tilt against the Pacers. Wade has played just one game in the last two weeks, and it came in a loss against Indiana when he scored 15 points and tallied six turnovers. Wade came up lame in the second half and was initially diagnosed with leg cramps, but has not played since. The Knicks have won 12 of their last 16 games as they try to make the playoffs. They remain two games behind the Atlanta Hawks in the loss column.
