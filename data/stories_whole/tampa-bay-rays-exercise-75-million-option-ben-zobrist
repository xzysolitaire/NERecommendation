ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Ben Zobrist's $7.5 million option for 2015 has been exercised by the Tampa Bay Rays. The two-time All-Star hit .272 this year with 10 homers and 52 RBIs. Next year he could become the first player to spend 10 seasons with the Rays. Zobrist, 33, is Tampa Bay's career leader in doubles (229) and walks (542). He started 74 games at second this season and also started at shortstop and all three outfield spots. Zobrist is the first major league player since at least 1914 to play in 200 career games at second, shortstop and right field. HeÂ finished eighth in the American League MVP voting in 2009, one season after he helped Tampa Bay reach its only World Series. Tampa Bay announced its decision Friday. The Rays would have owed a $500,000 buyout if they had declined the option.
