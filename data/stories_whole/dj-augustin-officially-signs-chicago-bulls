MILWAUKEE -- The Chicago Bulls officially signed guard D.J. Augustin on Friday. "I'm excited, man," said Augustin, who made his debut Friday night against the Milwaukee Bucks. "It's a great team, great organization. I'm happy to be a part of it." Augustin was scoreless in 12 minutes off the bench in the Bulls' 91-90 win. Augustin, who was waived by the Toronto Raptors earlier in the week, is expected to vie for minutes with veteran Mike James, who is recovering from a knee sprain, and second-year point guard Marquis Teague. Starter Kirk Hinrich has struggled to find a rhythm since Derrick Rose went down with a torn medial meniscus last month. "Just come in, bring energy," Augustin said of his mindset. "Play hard, do whatever Coach and the team needs me to do to help us win." Augustin drove to Milwaukee on Friday morning with assistant GM Randy BrownÂ and said he hadn't gotten much of a chance to speak with Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau yet. "He can shoot," Thibodeau said before the game. "He can shoot. We're in need of shooting, and he's got some experience. He's relatively young. He's done a little bit of everything. He's started, he's come off the bench, he's playing in some playoff games. Hopefully this will be a good opportunity for him." Augustin is a career 40 percent shooter but was shooting just 29.2 percent from the field with the Raptors before being waived. "Hopefully I can get some minutes," he said. "And get that confidence and rhythm going."
