The Jacksonville Jaguars' current plan regarding Justin Blackmon is to have the wide receiver return once he's reinstated from an indefinite suspension for multiple violations of the NFL's substance-abuse policy, league sources told ESPN. The Jaguars have no sense of when -- or even if -- Blackmon will ever be eligible to play in the NFL. The Jaguars don't expect Blackmon to be available this year -- he sat out the first four games and the last eight games of 2013 because of suspensions. In between, Blackmon made 19 catches for 326 yards in his first two games back from the first suspension.
