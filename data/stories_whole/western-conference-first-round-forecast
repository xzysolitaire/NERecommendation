We asked our ESPN Forecast panel who would prevail in Round 1 of the Western Conference playoffs, and our voters see all of the top seeds advancing. But not without a little drama. The closest vote saw the panel picking Houston over Portland in seven. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games, and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
