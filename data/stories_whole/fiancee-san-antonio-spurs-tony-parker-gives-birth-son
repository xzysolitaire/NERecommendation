SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs point guard Tony Parker nursed a sprained ankle by pacing the floor awaiting the birth of his son, Josh. Parker and fiancee Axelle Francine welcomed their first child early Wednesday morning, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The birth came hours before the Spurs were to play the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 of their first-round series, which is tied at two games apiece. Parker started Wednesday night despite nursing a Grade 1 sprained left ankle sustained in the first half of Game 4. Struggling offensively throughout much of the series, perhaps Parker can have a resurgence like Manu Ginobili has following the recent birth of his third son. Ginobili welcomed his third child, Luca, on April 21.
