DALLAS -- Houston Rockets star James Harden will miss his second consecutive game due to a left thumb injury. Harden will be on the active roster for Wednesday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks, but he will not be in uniform. Jeremy Lin will start in his place for the second straight night. Harden, who ranks seventh in the league in scoring with 23.7 points per game, injured the thumb on his shooting hand during Saturday's loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. This will be the eighth game missed by Harden this season. One of those was the Rockets' previous meeting against the Mavs, when he sat out a 111-104 home loss on Dec. 23 due to a sprained ankle.
