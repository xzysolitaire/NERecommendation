DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau is upset that Derrick Rose isn't getting more calls early in the season. Rose, who has shot just 28.8 percent (15 of 52) from the field through the first three games, has been to the free throw line just 10 times. After initially declining to answer a question as to why Rose hasn't gone to the line more, Thibodeau paused before giving his opinion. "I'll say this," Thibodeau said. "I don't know anyone who drives as hard as he does, nor as fast as he does. I think sometimes he's penalized for being a nice guy. I'll leave it at that." For his part, Rose has tried to take his recent struggles in stride. "I can't complain about it," he said. "It's just the way the game is going. All I can do is continue to drive and I guess try to get fouled." This isn't the first time that the Bulls have been upset that Rose hasn't been getting whistles. Rose was fined $25,000 in March 2012 after opening up about his frustration regarding a perceived lack of foul calls. "I've gotta be the only superstar in the league that's going through what I'm going through right now," Rose said at the time. "But I can't say too much about it." After a practice that lasted over three hours Monday, Rose didn't want to get into a war of words with officials. "Like I said, I can't complain about it," Rose said. "All I can do is continue to drive. I guess I'm not getting fouled or I guess they've just got to get used to me. I understand I'm creating some contact, but I'm just trying to play through it." Rose acknowledged that he continues to keep an open dialogue with officials during games. He sounds confident that his game, and the whistles, will turn in his favor soon. "Really that I think I'm getting hit and that's all I can say to them," he said of his conversations with officials during games. "But that can't stop me from driving or taking the shots that I'm taking." Rose and the Bulls face the Indiana PacersÂ on Wednesday night.
