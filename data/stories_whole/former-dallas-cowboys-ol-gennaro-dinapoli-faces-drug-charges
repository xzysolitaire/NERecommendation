NEWTOWN, Conn. -- A former National Football League player is facing charges of selling prescription painkillers from his Connecticut home. Ex-Dallas Cowboys player Gennaro DiNapoli was charged last week with two counts of selling oxycodone. The Newtown resident was released on $150,000 bond and is due in Danbury Superior Court on June 17. A message left on his cellphone Friday hasn't been returned. An arrest warrant affidavit says DiNapoli sold Drug Enforcement Administration undercover agents more than $6,000 worth of oxycodone pills in two transactions in April and May. DiNapoli played seven seasons as a center and a guard in the NFL. He also played for the Oakland Raiders and the Tennessee Titans.
