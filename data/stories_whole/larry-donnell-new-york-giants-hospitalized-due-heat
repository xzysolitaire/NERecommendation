EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell was taken from the team facility to a local hospital by ambulance due to a heat-related issue following Wednesday's minicamp practice, the team announced. Donnell was treated for dehydration and is expected to be released from the hospital Wednesday night, according to the Giants. Temperatures have reached 90 degrees here on each of the first two days of the three-day mandatory minicamp. Tight end Daniel Fells and defensive tackle Markus Kuhn both had to leave Tuesday's practice because they weren't feeling well, but neither required an ambulance and both were at practice Wednesday. Donnell, 25, is in his second year with the Giants after signing as an undrafted free agent last year. He is one of several players competing for reps at tight end in a very crowded field that has no apparent starter at this time.
