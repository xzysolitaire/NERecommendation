DENVER -- Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson was set to return for Monday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves after missing nearly a month because of a left rib fracture. Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said before tipoff that Lawson, injured in a collision on Feb. 8 at Detroit, had been cleared to play. "I expect him to be a little rusty," Shaw said. "He hasn't really done anything involving contact with the team but we are excited to have him back and ready to play. We are looking forward to having him on the court. The Nuggets have missed Lawson, their primary offensive catalyst. Denver has gone 1-8 without Lawson, losing the last five in a row.
