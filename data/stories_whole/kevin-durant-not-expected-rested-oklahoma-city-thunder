Oklahoma City Thunder coach Scott Brooks has no plans to give Kevin Durant a day of rest over the club's final four games, according to the Daily Oklahoman. "It's nothing that I've talked about and worried about," Brooks told the website. "Fatigue is not an issue with our group. His minutes are right at 38 to 39 minutes a game. During this stretch, we've had eight games in 12 nights, so there's some time off that we give in practice and shootaround. We're talking 39 minutes of your day. I think he can handle that at age 25." The Thunder (57-21) are all but locked into the second seed in the powerful Western Conference, leading the Los Angeles Clippers by 2Â½ games. Durant, averaging a league-leading 32 points and one of the leading contenders to win the MVP award, has averaged just under 39 minutes per game this season. On Tuesday, he had 23 points in a win against the Sacramento Kings, stopping his streak of scoring at least 25 points in 41 consecutive games. Durant had 27 the next night in a 107-101 win over the Clippers.
