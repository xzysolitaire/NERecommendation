SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A man charged with killing the 2-year-old son of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson in South Dakota last fall is facing charges in a new alleged incident. Authorities say Joseph Patterson was arrested early Wednesday on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault, interference with emergency communication and injury to property. A criminal complaint lists a woman as the victim of the allegations. Authorities didn't immediately disclose her relationship to Patterson. Patterson has been free on $750,000 bond while he awaits an October trial on charges including murder in the death of Tyrese Ruffin in Sioux Falls last October. Patterson was living with Ruffin's mother at the time of the boy's death. Peterson had recently found out that Tyrese was his son.
