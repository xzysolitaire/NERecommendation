KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Madison Bumgarner's World Series performance earned him a spot in the Hall of Fame -- well, at least for his caps. The San Francisco Giants ace donated caps he wore during his Game 1 and 5 wins against Kansas City plus his hat from his Game 7 save Wednesday night. The Hall said it also collected the spikes of Game 7 winner Jeremy Affeldt plus Buster Posey's bat from the World Series finale and Pablo Sandoval's jersey. Hunter Pence's bat from Game 4, when he had three hits and three RBIs, also is headed to the Hall, located in Cooperstown, New York.
