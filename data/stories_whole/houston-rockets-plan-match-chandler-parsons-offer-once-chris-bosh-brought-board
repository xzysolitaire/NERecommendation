A source told ESPNDallas.com earlier Friday that the Houston Rockets intended to match the Dallas Mavericks' three-year, $46 million offer sheet to restricted free agent Chandler Parsons after signing Chris Bosh. However, Bosh is now expected to re-sign with the Miami Heat, throwing the Rockets' plans up in the air. Houston has until 11:59 p.m. Sunday to match the Mavs' offer to Parsons, who currently accounts for a $2.9 million hold on the Rockets' cap. The Rockets can exceed the cap to keep Parsons. The Parsons offer sheet, which starts with a $14.7 million salary, accounts for the rest of the Mavs' cap space after the soon-to-be-official deals for Dirk Nowitzki and Devin Harris are done.
