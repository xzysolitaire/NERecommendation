LOS ANGELES -- Golden State Warriors forward Jermaine O'Neal confronted forward Blake Griffin in the hallway outside the Los Angeles Clippers' locker room at Staples Center after L.A.'s 111-98 win Wednesday night. The two had a heated conversation that was quickly broken up by a Clippers official who led Griffin to the adjacent news conference room. O'Neal, 35, had dressed and was waiting outside the Clippers' locker room to talk to Griffin. Griffin, who was walking to the news conference room to take questions from reporters, could be heard telling O'Neal to "leave that s--- on the court" before the two were separated and briefly shook hands. With 8:55 left in the fourth quarter, O'Neal got a technical foul as he walked toward the Clippers' bench and continued talking to Griffin before O'Neal's teammates and officials directed him back to the Warriors' bench. The games between the Clippers and Warriors have been especially physical and heated over the past two seasons, with Griffin getting ejected when they met Christmas Day. Griffin did not care to discuss his conversations with O'Neal when later taking questions. "Nah," he said. "That's between me and him."
