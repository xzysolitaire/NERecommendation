Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose is donating $1 million to After School Matters, a Chicago-based non-profit organization devoted to providing out-of-school programs for teenagers. The teen population that After School Matters serves is almost entirely minority and living at or below the poverty level. "To have a strong community of people who believe in your potential can make all the difference in the world," said Rose, an NBA MVP and three-time All-Star. "So many people have invested in me and I want to do the same for Chicago's teens."
