CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan honored Al Jefferson by taking out a full-page advertisement Sunday in the Charlotte Observer after the 6-foot-10 center was named third-team All-NBA. Jefferson has proven to be the franchise's best free agent signing ever. He joined Charlotte last July and was the only player in the Eastern Conference to average a double-double for the 2013-14 season. The ad praised "Big Al" for his "dedication and commitment to the franchise" and congratulated him for winning the Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice during the season. Jefferson led the franchise to its first playoff appearance since 2010, although Charlotte was swept in the first round by the Miami Heat. Jefferson was hobbled throughout the series after injuring his foot in Game 1.
