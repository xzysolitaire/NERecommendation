MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies have opted against making a qualifying offer to Ed Davis, allowing the forward to become an unrestricted free agent. Grizzlies officials announced the decision Monday on the team's Web site. The 25-year-old Davis averaged 5.7 points, 4.1 rebounds and 15.2 minutes per game for the Grizzlies last season. Memphis acquired the 6-foot-10 forward along with Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye in January 2013 as part of a three-team trade that sent Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to Toronto and brought Jose Calderon to Detroit.
