C.J. Miles announced Wednesday on Twitter that he is headed to the Indiana Pacers via free agency. Miles and the Pacers agreed to a four-year deal in the $18 million range, sources confirmed. The deal could potentially cut into the Pacers' flexibility when it comes to trying to re-sign swingman Lance Stephenson. The Indianapolis Star first reported Wednesday that Miles had struck a multiyear deal with the Pacers. Miles spent the past two seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He averaged 9.9 points in 51 games for the Cavs this past season. The Pacers also struck bargain deals Thursday with European prospect Damjan Rudez and undrafted free agent Shayne Whittington as they try to improve their roster after a disappointing second half of the season and an Eastern Conference finals defeat to Miami. Indiana can't sign Miles until July 10, when a leaguewide moratorium on signings and trades is lifted. The Pacers might be forced to make tough decisions on players such as Luis Scola and Chris Copeland to ensure they have enough room under the luxury-tax line to afford Stephenson, with whom they've reached an impasse in contract talks, according to ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard.
