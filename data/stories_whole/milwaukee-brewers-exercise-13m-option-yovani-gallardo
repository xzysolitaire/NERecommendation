The Milwaukee Brewers exercised their $13 million option for starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo, the team announced Friday. The 28-year-old right-hander went 8-11 with a 3.51 ERA in 32 starts this season, his eighth with the Brewers. From 2009-2012, Gallardo won at least 13 games and tallied at least 200 strikeouts in each season. Gallardo, an All-Star and Silver Slugger Award winner in 2010, is also the Brewers' career leader in strikeouts. The Brewers selected Gallardo in the second round of the 2004 draft. Milwaukee also announced they declined a $14.5 million option on second baseman Rickie Weeks. Weeks hit .274 this season with eight home runs and 29 RBIs.
