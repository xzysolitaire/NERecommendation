The injury-hit Indiana PacersÂ have signed free-agent guard Gal Mekel. Sources told ESPN.com that Mekel, who is in his second NBA season and is one of Israel's two exports in the league alongside Sacramento's Omri Casspi, also drew interest from Oklahoma City since his release by the Dallas Mavericks last week. The Pacers have been on the hunt for backcourt reinforcements after injuries to Rodney Stuckey (foot), George Hill (knee) and C.J. Watson (foot) in addition to Paul George's potentially season-ending compound leg fracture suffered Aug. 1. Indiana will obtained a hardship waiver from the league to add a 16th player. Mekel made the Mavericks' opening night roster out of training camp -- beating out three others with NBA experience for Dallas' final spot -- but was subsequently let go when the Mavs had an unexpected opportunity to re-sign J.J. Barea at a minimum salary. Barea played a key role as a reserve on the Mavs' 2011 championship team. Mekel played sparingly in the second half of his rookie season after suffering a January knee injury but bounced back with a strong preseason with the Mavericks after teaming with Casspi over the summer to lead Israel's basketball team to 2015 EuroBasket qualification despite Israel being stripped of all its home games in qualifying.
