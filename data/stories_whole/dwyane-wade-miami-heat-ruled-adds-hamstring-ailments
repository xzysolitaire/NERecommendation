AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Dwyane Wade missed his 20th game of the season for the Miami Heat on Friday night in their 110-78 rout of the Detroit Pistons, this one due to a tight left hamstring that he suffered late in the game Wednesday at Indiana. Wade said he wasn't even able to test the hamstring, leaving his status for Saturday's game in Milwaukee also in doubt. He did say, however, the injury was not as bad as the hamstring pull he suffered in 2010 that cost him nearly a month during the preseason. Wade has missed games this season because of knee issues, Achilles soreness, a sore foot, back spasms, migraines and to rest in addition to the hamstring. The Heat were significantly shorthanded Friday as Ray Allen missed a second consecutive game with the stomach flu, Mario Chalmers missed the game with a bruised quad, Greg Oden was out with back spasms, and Wade was a late scratch. That meant the Heat were without three normal starters plus their top reserve. The team ended up using its 19th different starting lineup of the season as James Jones made his first start since 2012.
