AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- The Houston Rockets are without leading scorer James Harden for Saturday night's game at Detroit. Harden is out with a sprained right ankle, and Francisco Garcia was in the starting lineup instead for the Rockets. Houston is also without guard Jeremy Lin, who has been bothered by back spasms. Harden is averaging 23.9 points per game, although he was held to only 12 in Friday's 114-81 loss at Indiana.
