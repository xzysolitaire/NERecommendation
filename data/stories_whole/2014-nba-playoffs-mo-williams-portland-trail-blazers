SAN ANTONIO -- A strained groin sidelined Trail Blazers sixth man Mo Williams for a third consecutive game in Portland's season-ending loss to San Antonio in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals. Williams originally suffered the injury in Game 1 of the series but played through it. He was limited to nine minutes in Game 2 and has not played since. "There's no way," said Portland coach Terry Stotts, who was uncertain pregame about Williams' status if the Blazers managed to extend the series by winning Wednesday's game at the AT&T Center. "We're holding him out. It was at a point where it wasn't going to get better without rest." Williams' absence further depletes an already thin bench. However, reserve guard Will Barton rose to the moment with an expanded role in Portland's Game 4 win, scoring 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 30 minutes. Barton played a total of only one minute in Portland's six-game first-round series against the Houston Rockets. Stotts would like limit All-Star point guard Damian Lillard to 40 minutes, but that's a luxury he might not have without Williams in uniform. "We'll play Damian as much as we need to but rest him when we can rest him," Stotts said.
