SAN FRANCISCO -- Manager Matt WilliamsÂ stayed with his regular lineup with the Washington Nationals one loss from elimination, while not ruling out using Ryan Zimmerman in a key moment as a pinch hitter. Zimmerman is 3 for 17 against Madison Bumgarner, San Francisco's Game 3 starter Monday in the NL Division Series, and Williams wanted his best defense behind Doug Fister. Zimmerman's health didn't factor into the decision but rather that some Nationals left-handed hitters have had success against 18-game winner and lefty Bumgarner. Zimmerman, recovering from a torn right hamstring, is one of the club's best right-handed hitters but the veteran third baseman and outfielder was limited to 61 games this season because of the hamstring.
