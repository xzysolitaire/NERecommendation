ARLINGTON, Texas -- Rangers outfielder Alex Rios will become a free agent after the World Series. The Rangers have declined a $14 million option for 2015, and will pay Rios a $2 million buyout. After Wednesday's decision, they could still work out another deal for Rios to return next season. Rios was acquired from the White Sox in August 2013 after then-Texas slugger Nelson Cruz was suspended for the final 50 games of that season. Rios hit .280 with four home runs and 54 RBIs in 131 games this year. He sprained his left ankle in August and didn't play after Sept. 4 because of an infected thumb. The buyout ends a six-year deal Rios signed with Toronto in 2008. He made $13 million with Texas this year.
