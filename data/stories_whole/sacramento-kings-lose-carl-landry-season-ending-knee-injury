SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento Kings say reserve forward Carl Landry will miss the remainder of the season with a medial meniscus tear in his right knee that will require surgery. The team said Saturday a recent MRI exam revealed the injury, and surgery would be scheduled later. He missed his fifth straight game Friday night against Toronto with what was being listed as a sore knee. Landry, in his second stint with Sacramento, averaged 4.2 points and 3.2 rebounds in 12.9 minutes over 18 games with one start this season. Also Saturday, the Kings signed guard Orlando Johnson to a second 10-day contract.
