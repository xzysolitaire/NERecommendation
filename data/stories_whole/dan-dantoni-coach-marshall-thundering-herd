The Marshall Thundering Herd have filled their coaching vacancy with NBA assistant Dan D'Antoni, athletic director Mike Hamrick announced Thursday. D'Antoni, the older brother of Los Angeles Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni, served on his brother's coaching staffs with the Lakers, New York Knicks and the Phoenix Suns. Both D'Antonis played at Marshall, with Dan averaging a team-high 17.5 points as a junior during the 1968-69 season. Dan D'Antoni, 66, will replaceÂ Tom Herrion, whose contract was bought out by Marshall on March 14 with two years remaining. Herrion had coached the Thundering Herd for the past four seasons.
