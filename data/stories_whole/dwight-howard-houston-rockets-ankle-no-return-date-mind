Dwight Howard has received a second shot in his sore left ankle, Houston Rockets coach Kevin McHale said following Tuesday's 105-96 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. McHale said there was mostly soft tissue inflammation in the ankle, which has kept the All-Star center out of five of the team's last seven games. Earlier Tuesday, Howard told the Houston Chronicle that he had also had the troublesome ankle drained of fluid, and that he had o return date in mind, but was "not worried at all" that the injury would linger for the reminder of the season. Howard also told the Chronicle he would not play in Wednesday night's game in Toronto.
