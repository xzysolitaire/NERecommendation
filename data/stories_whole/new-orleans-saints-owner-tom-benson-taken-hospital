WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. -- New Orleans SaintsÂ and New Orleans Pelicans owner Tom Benson was taken to the hospital during Tuesday's practice and later released, team spokesman Greg Bensel said. "The altitude got to him. He's fine," Bensel said. Benson, 87, was sent to the hospital as a precautionary measure after receiving oxygen, as he has been having issues with the altitude at the Saints' new training camp site in the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia. He was also taken to the hospital last week and was treated for dehydration. "This morning, Mr. Benson left practice after not feeling well due to symptoms related to the altitude here in West Virginia," the Saints said in a statement. "(He) was given a series of tests, of which, doctors did not find any issues or complications. He was treated with oxygen and has been released." Benson was also taken to an emergency room during the NFL owners meetings in Atlanta in May to be evaluated for a possible concussion after stumbling and hitting his head. He was still recovering from a minor knee surgery at the time and tried to rush back to be in attendance for New Orleans' Super Bowl bid. Benson has been in attendance daily for Saints practice during training camp.
