NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans Pelicans starting point guard Jrue Holiday is sidelined indefinitely with a lower right leg injury. Holiday, who met with reporters shortly before Friday night's game against Dallas, says the injury is a stress fracture in his tibia. He believes he played with the injury for an undetermined amount of time before the pain led him to ask trainers to take a closer look. Holiday played 29 minutes in Wednesday night's 102-96 loss at home to Washington. He now is using a stabilizing boot to walk and says he expects to be re-evaluated in about a month. In 34 games this season, the 6-foot-4 Holiday is averaging 14.3 points, 7.9 assists and 4.2 rebounds. His injury comes while New Orleans also plays without leading scorer Ryan Anderson, who has a herniated disk.
