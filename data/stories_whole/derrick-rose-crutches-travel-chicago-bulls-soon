CHICAGO -- Derrick Rose is off crutches and is expected to resume traveling with the Bulls in a few weeks as he continues to recover from a torn medial meniscus in his right knee. "He's coming along fine," coach Tom Thibodeau said after Monday's shootaround. "He's off the crutches. He's doing more and more but he still has a long way to go. But he'll probably start traveling in the next couple weeks. He's doing great." Rose has been spotted both in the Berto Center and the United Center in recent weeks while receiving treatment. He appears to be in good spirits as he continues his second straight year of rehab. He did not play at all last season as he recovered from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered in the Bulls' first playoff game in 2012. Despite Rose's injury problems and the recent trade of All-Star forward Luol Deng to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Thibodeau is still confident that Bulls management, led by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, is committed to building a championship contender. "Look, Jerry's owned the team a long time," Thibodeau said. "Not many people own two major sports franchises. So I think he has a very good understanding of winning and losing and what goes into it. There's a lot of tough decisions that have to be made. I don't think he ever shies away from that. And he's treated me great so that's all I can go by." Bulls guard Jimmy Butler missed Saturday's game against the Charlotte Bobcats because of a thigh bruise but is expected to play Monday night against the Washington Wizards. "He went through the whole shootaround," Thibodeau said. "Feels a lot better, ready to go."
