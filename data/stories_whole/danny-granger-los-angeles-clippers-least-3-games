HOUSTON -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Danny Granger was sent back to Los Angeles with a strained left hamstring and will miss at least the final three games of the Clippers' five-game road trip. Granger injured his ankle in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game against the Dallas Mavericks and did not return. Granger didn't think the injury would sideline him too long when he spoke after Thursday's game. "I'm walking around, I don't think it's that bad," Granger said. "I'm optimistic."
