CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bobby Phills' retired No. 13 jersey is heading back to Charlotte. Phills' jersey was originally raised to the rafters at the Charlotte Coliseum on Feb. 9, 2000, following his death in a car accident a month earlier. However, when the Hornets moved to New Orleans, his retired jersey went with the team. Now that the Hornets name has returned to Charlotte, so too will the jersey. It will be hung at the team's downtown arena Nov. 1 during a halftime ceremony. Phills is the only player in Hornets' history to have his jersey retired. Hornets president and COO Fred Whitfield said a release Wednesday that during the team's rebranding process, "one of the most important elements to us was to once again honor the retired jersey of Bobby Phills."
