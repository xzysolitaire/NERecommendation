Tyson Chandler returned to the New York Knicks' lineup on Tuesday after a four-game absence due to bronchitis. Chandler started alongside Andrea Bargnani, Carmelo Anthony, Raymond Felton and Iman Shumpert against the Charlotte Bobcats. With Chandler out, the Knicks have relied heavily on Kenyon Martin to defend the rim. Their defensive numbers have improved of late. New York (15-22) has held opponents to an average of 89.0 points during its current five-game winning streak after yielding 103.8 per contest in the previous 10. Coach Mike Woodson was expected to play Chandler in limited minutes against Charlotte. Chandler, the 2011-12 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, first came down with the illness on Jan. 5. He left the Knicks' game against the Dallas Mavericks that night in the first quarter due to what the team called an "upper respiratory" illness. The Knicks have won all five games since Chandler became ill.
