Anderson went 1-3 with a 2.91 ERA in an injury-filled season, his first in Colorado after a five-year stay with the Oakland Athletics. Anderson had two stints on the 60-day disabled list. The first was with a fractured left index finger and the second with lower back problems. He ended up starting just eight games, finishing with 29 strikeouts and 13 walks.
