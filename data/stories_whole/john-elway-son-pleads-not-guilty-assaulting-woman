DENVER -- Jack Elway, the son of Broncos general manager John Elway, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he assaulted his girlfriend and pulled her from a car by her hair. Court records show 24-year-old John Albert Elway entered the plea on Wednesday. He was charged with assault and disturbing the peace after the Saturday incident near a college campus in downtown Denver. Police reports show Elway's girlfriend told officers he shoved her to the ground when she tried to get back into the car, causing scrapes. Police say Elway then fled the scene. He is free after posting $550 bond. His attorney, Harvey Steinberg, did not immediately return a call for comment. A Broncos spokesman says the case is a personal family matter. A trial is scheduled for August.
