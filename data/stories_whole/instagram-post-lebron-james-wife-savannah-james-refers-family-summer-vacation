A recent Instagram post by LeBron James' wife, who called Akron, Ohio, "Home sweet home," was not made in reference to her husband's future with the Miami Heat, a source close to the four-time MVP told ESPN.com's Brian Windhorst. Savannah James caused a stir when she posted an Instagram photo of a map of Ohio, with "Akron" written across the image and a star to indicate the city's location. The image, which was posted Sunday, also includes a caption which says: "Home sweet home!! The countdown is real! #330" According to the source, the post refers to the James family's summer plans. Both LeBron and Savannah James usually spend the majority of the summer at their home in Akron, their hometown, with their two sons. Heat president Pat Riley announced last week that the couple also is expecting a baby girl. The post, however, drew a strong reaction on social media, fueling speculation that James could be interested in rejoining the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent. James has until June 30 to decide whether he will opt out of the final two years of his contract with the Heat and become an unrestricted free agent. He is scheduled to make $20 million next season. After Miami's season-ending loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, James told reporters he would take a vacation with his family before considering his contract options. James did indicate that he welcomed the opportunity to become a free agent and have the same level of flexibility he was afforded in 2010, when he signed with Miami after spending his first seven years in Cleveland.
