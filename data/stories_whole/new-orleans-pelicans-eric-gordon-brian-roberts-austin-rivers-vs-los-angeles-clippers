NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Pelicans say guards Eric Gordon, Brian Roberts and Austin Rivers have all been ruled out for Wednesday night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Gordon is missing his third straight game with left knee tendinitis that began to limit his play last Friday night in Atlanta. Roberts is sidelined by a bone bruise in his left knee and Rivers has an upper respiratory infection. Gordon, a starter, is averaging 15.4 points. Roberts, who averages 9.5 points, has started at point guard since Jrue Holiday went out for the season with a stress fracture in his right shin on Jan. 10. Rivers' absence means he'll miss a chance to play against the team coach by his father, Doc Rivers.
