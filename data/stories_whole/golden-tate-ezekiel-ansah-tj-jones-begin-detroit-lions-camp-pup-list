The Detroit Lions will begin training camp with two starters and one rookie on the active physically unable to perform list. The team designated wide receiver Golden Tate, defensive end Ezekiel Ansah and wide receiver T.J. Jones on the PUP list when official transactions came out Wednesday. As members of the active PUP list, they can be moved to the active roster at any time. Ansah missed spring workouts while recovering from shoulder surgery, and Jones had surgery to repair his shoulder toward the end of spring workouts. Tate injured his shoulder during spring workouts. There has been no indication any of the three will miss any time during the regular season, but Lions coach Jim Caldwell is scheduled to address the media for the first time this season Sunday when veterans report to camp. Ansah led all rookies with eight sacks in 14 games and is expected to start at open defensive end this fall. Detroit signed Tate to a five-year, $31 million contract during free agency in March and drafted Jones with a sixth-round pick in May. Jones said he hurt his shoulder during the Pinstripe Bowl, his final college game with Notre Dame.
