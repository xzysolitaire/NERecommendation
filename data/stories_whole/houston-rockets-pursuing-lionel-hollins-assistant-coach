The Houston Rockets are making a hard push to convince former Memphis Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins to join Kevin McHale's staff as an assistant, according to sources close to the process. However, sources tell ESPN.com that the Rockets recognize it will be difficult to land Hollins, who continues to covet his next opportunity as a head coach after his exit in Memphis following the 2013 playoffs. The Grizzlies declined to offer Hollins a new contract following a 56-win season in 2012-13, which saw them advance to the Western Conference finals before being ousted by the San Antonio Spurs. Hollins has interviewed with a number of teams this spring that ultimately hired others, as well as two teams still looking for a head coach: The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers.
