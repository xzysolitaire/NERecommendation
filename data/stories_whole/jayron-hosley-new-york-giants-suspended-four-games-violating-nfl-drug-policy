Another member of the New York Giants' secondary has been suspended for violating the NFL's drug policy as cornerback Jayron Hosley will miss the first four games of the 2014 season, it was announced Wednesday. Hosley was suspended for violating the league's policy on "substances of abuse." That's the part of the policy that covers recreational drugs, as opposed to performance-enhancing drugs. Hosley remains eligible to participate in all offseason practices and preseason games. He may return to the active roster Sept. 26, following the Giants' Week 4 game Sept. 25 against the Redskins. Last week, the NFL announced that Giants safety Will Hill would be suspended for the first six games of the season for his latest violation of the drug policy. Monday, the Giants waived Hill, who has been been suspended for violating the NFL'sÂ drug policy three times in three years. The Giants added a great deal of depth at cornerback this offseason, and Hosley wasn't exactly a sure bet to make the roster. This is the first drug suspension for Hosley, who was selected in the third round of the 2012 draft.
