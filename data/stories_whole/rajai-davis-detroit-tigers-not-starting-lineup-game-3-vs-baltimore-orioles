DETROIT -- Tigers outfielder Rajai Davis is out of the starting lineup Sunday for Game 3 of their AL Division Series against Baltimore. Davis has been dealing with a pelvic strain, and Detroit is starting Don Kelly in his place in center field. The Tigers trail the best-of-five series 2-0. Manager Brad Ausmus says he was concerned about starting Davis and potentially having to pull him out of the game. He says Davis is available as a substitute. Baltimore's Delmon Young is starting in left field after lifting the Orioles to a 7-6 victory in Game 2. Young hit a three-run double in the eighth inning as a pinch-hitter in that game.
