TORONTO -- Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas will play in Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, two days after being charged with drunken driving. Valanciunas was not made available to reporters at Tuesday's practice, but Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri confirmed he will be in the lineup. The 21-year-old Lithuanian was arrested Monday in Wasaga Beach, Ontario. Police say they began investigating after a report that a vehicle went through a drive-thru with open beer bottles visible. On Monday, Valanciunas said in a release that he apologized to the organization, his teammates, family and fans, adding he regretted "any negativity this incident has brought upon them." Valanciunas is in his second season with the playoff-bound Raptors, and is averaging 11 points and 8.6 rebounds a game.
