NEW YORK -- The NBA has fined Memphis Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph $25,000 for publicly criticizing officials after Memphis lost 100-92 in Houston. Rod Thorn, president of basketball operations, announced the fine Friday. Randolph was unhappy Thursday night that James Harden, who was 2 for 9 from the floor, went to the free throw line 25 times. Harden was 9 of 11 at the line in the fourth quarter and became the first player in NBA history to register 27 points on two or fewer field goals. The Grizzlies forward was given a technical late in the game. Afterward, Randolph said the officials made the matchup eight-against-five and dictated the game with what he called "horrible refereeing."
