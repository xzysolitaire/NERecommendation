OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors center Andrew Bogut was back in the starting lineup after missing four games with a bruise in his pelvis and groin area. Bogut finished with six points and 11 rebounds in Golden State's 130-102 victory over the Utah Jazz. The Warriors were still without power forward David Lee, who sat out his sixth straight game with an injured right hamstring. Warriors coach Mark Jackson said before Sunday night's game that an MRI on Lee showed nerve inflammation in his hamstring. Jackson is unsure when Lee will return. Draymond Green started at power forward again. Bogut was injured in Golden State's win over Memphis on March 28 when Grizzlies center Marc Gasol kneed Bogut while attempting a layup.
