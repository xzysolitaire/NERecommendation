FALL RIVER, Mass. -- Lawyers for Aaron Hernandez are questioning the validity of a search warrant executed at the former New England Patriots player's home. In court on Wednesday, the defense questioned a state trooper involved in the June 2013 search of Hernandez's North Attleborough home as part of the investigation into the killing of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who is held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder, appeared in court but did not speak. The defense said the affidavit filed in the application for the warrant mentions that police were looking for GPS evidence, but the actual search warrant does not mention GPS evidence. The trooper said the affidavit and warrant were attached with a paper clip. Defense attorneys are seeking to have some evidence dismissed. The judge did not immediately rule.
