Washington Wizards guard John Wall has accepted USA Basketball's invitation to attend its training camp next week in Las Vegas. Sources told ESPN.com that USAB has wanted Wall in camp for weeks and merely wanted to make sure that the Wizards' All-Star was able to play at full capacity after a longer-than-expected season before making it official. In a breakout season for both him and his team, Wall made the Eastern Conference All-Star squad and led the Wizards to the second round of the playoffs after his omission from Team USA's original pool of players announced in January. Wall will join DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors and new Dallas Mavericks signee Chandler Parsons as newcomers to the original Team USA roster. Coach Mike Krzyzewski and USAB chairman Jerry Colangelo have assembled a group of 19 players -- Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin dropped out Thursday -- to audition in Las Vegas, from which they will pick a final 12-man roster to represent the United States in FIBA's inaugural World Cup of Basketball starting Aug. 30 in Spain.
