AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Detroit center Andre Drummond left the Pistons' game Saturday night against Indiana because of a neck injury. Drummond fell to the ground with 6:32 remaining in the first quarter, after he appeared to be hit in the head inadvertently by Roy Hibbert of the Pacers during a scramble near the basket. Drummond stayed down through an entire timeout, and a stretcher was eventually brought onto the court. But he was able to get up and walk off toward the tunnel with some assistance. The Pistons said Drummond will not return to the game and will undergo further testing. Drummond entered the game averaging 13.3 points and 12.9 rebounds on the season. He was shooting 62 percent from the field.
