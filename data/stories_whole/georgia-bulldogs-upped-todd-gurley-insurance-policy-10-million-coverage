As GeorgiaÂ running back Todd Gurley was serving a four-game suspension for accepting money for autographs, the University of Georgia spent more money on him to support him when he did get back on the field. Sources told ESPN.com that, within the last two weeks, Georgia upped Gurley's insurance policy to $10 million in coverage -- $5 million for total disability if Gurley got injured and never played again and $5 million in loss of value insurance, which would kick in if Gurley injured himself and slipped in the draft. Gurley, who tore his ACL against Auburn in his first game back, previously had $5 million in total disability and $2.5 million in loss of value insurance. The policy was written by International Specialty Insurance. In his latest draft big board, published Nov. 12, ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. listed Gurley as his No. 8 overall pick. Sources say that Gurley would start to collect on his loss of value insurance if he slipped out of the first round. He would collect the full $5 million if he somehow went undrafted. He also could collect $5 million if the injury prevented him from ever playing again. Sources say Georgia paid in between $50,000 and $60,000 for the policy. Over the last two years, the NCAA has allowed schools to pay such policies, most of which have been paid for through the Student Assistance Fund. The fund allows schools to pay for certain items for athletes in need, including insurance. The date for Gurley's surgery to repair his ACL has not yet been determined.
