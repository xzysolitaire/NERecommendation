INDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have released receiver LaVon Brazill. The announcement is not surprising after the NFL suspended Brazill for at least a year on July 3 for violating the league's substance-abuse policy for the second time. Brazill was banned for the first four games of the 2013 season for violating the policy. Brazill was expected to compete for one of the final spots on the Colts' roster this season Brazill was originally selected by the Colts in the sixth round (206th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft. In 25 career regular-season games with the team, he recorded 23 receptions for 347 yards and three touchdowns. Brazill also registered seven receptions for 144 yards and two touchdowns in three postseason games (two starts).
