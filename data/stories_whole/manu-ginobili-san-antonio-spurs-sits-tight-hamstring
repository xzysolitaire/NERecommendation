SAN ANTONIO -- Spurs guard Manu Ginobili missed San Antonio's game Wednesday night against the Dallas Mavericks because of tightness in his left hamstring. Ginobili was a late scratch for San Antonio (27-8), which also was without starting center Tiago Splitter. Splitter is expected to miss three to five weeks after spraining his right Saturday in the Spurs' victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Ginobili is averaging 12.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.7 assists.
