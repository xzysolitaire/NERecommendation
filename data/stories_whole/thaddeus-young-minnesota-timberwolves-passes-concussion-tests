MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Timberwolves forward Thaddeus Young has passed concussion tests and returned to practice after a scary collision with Chicago Bulls guard Jimmy Butler on Saturday night. Young took an inadvertent elbow to the head from Butler shortly before halftime on Saturday. He remained down on the court for more than 10 minutes while Timberwolves medical staff tended to him and was unable to finish the game. Young went through concussion tests on Sunday and was back at practice full-go on Monday. Young says he feels fortunate to have avoided a more serious injury. He says he will be ready to go when the Timberwolves return to the court in Brooklyn on Wednesday night. Young is averaging 17.7 points in the first three games of the season.
