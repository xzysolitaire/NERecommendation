The Detroit Lions have found another way to honor their late owner, William Clay Ford Sr. The team plans on wearing patches on its uniforms during the 2014 season with the letters "WCF" in white in the middle of the patch against a black football with one blue and one gray bar in the background. Ford Sr. bought the Lions for $4.5 million on Nov. 22, 1963, and owned the team until his death on March 9. His wife, Martha, gained control of the team upon Ford Sr.'s death, although his son, William Clay "Bill" Ford Jr., remained the team's vice chairman. Under Ford's ownership, the Lions won one playoff game in 50 years and had 14 winning seasons and 10 playoff appearances.Â  The Lions open their season on "Monday Night Football" against the New York Giants on Sept. 8 at Ford Field in Detroit.
