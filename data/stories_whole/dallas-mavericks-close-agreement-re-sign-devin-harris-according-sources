The Dallas Mavericks secured a verbal commitment from veteran point guard Devin Harris on Saturday to re-sign with the team, according to sources close to the process. Sources told ESPN.com that the Mavericks are putting the finishing touches on a deal that will span at least three seasons and possibly stretch to a fourth year in Harris' second stint with the club. The last few details are still being finalized with the Mavericks engaged on numerous free-agent fronts, but sources say Harris has committed to stay in Dallas and the value of the contract ultimately will exceed the original three-year, $9 million deal the sides struck last summer. A toe problem that had plagued Harris for some time was discovered last summer to be more severe than originally thought; as a result, Dallas and Harris mutually agreed to shelve that contract. After undergoing toe surgery, Harris played the second half of last season for the veteran's minimum of $1.3 million. The new deal can't officially be signed until July 10, when a league-wide moratorium on signings and trades is lifted, but free agents and team are permitted to come to verbal agreements in the interim, as Harris and Dallas have done. Point guard was a position of prime concern for Dallas entering free agency after it parted with Jose Calderon in the recent trade for Tyson Chandler. The Mavericks also are still pursuing Portland Trail Blazers free agent Mo Williams, who lives in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the offseason. Harris missed the first 41 games last season because of the toe problem. But he bounced back from the surgery to make a strong contribution to the Mavs' 49-win team and solid first-round showing against San Antonio. As a reflection of how highly Dallas values him, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban met face-to-face with Harris as soon as he was legally able to after free agency began Tuesday at 12:01 a.m.
