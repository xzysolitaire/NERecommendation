The NFL draft could land in New York City, Chicago or Los Angeles next year. League spokesman Brian McCarthy said Thursday that the league is "focusing" on those three cities as potential host sites for the 2015 draft, although other cities remain in the mix. The regular host site of the draft, Radio City Music Hall in New York, will not be available next year, according to multiple reports. The league also is looking at moving the dates of next year's draft to either April 22-25 or April 29-May 2, McCarthy said. That would be a change from the current three-day format. This year's draft was held May 8-10. The late date, which coincided with Mother's Day weekend, was questioned by some NFL teams.
