PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul will be limited in practice over the next two days by an injured right hamstring heading into Thursday's Game 3 of the team's first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors. "He won't do much," coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday. "He may do a little tomorrow but nothing today. We're not doing anything today anyway, but I don't need him doing anything." Paul injured his right hamstring late in the first half of the Clippers' 109-105 Game 1 loss on Saturday and received round-the-clock treatment heading into Game 2, when he played 27 minutes and had 12 points and 10 assists in a 138-98 blowout of the Warriors. Rivers had thought the two days between games would be most beneficial to J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford, who missed time heading into the postseason, but he now says no one needs the time off more than Paul, whose right hamstring was wrapped during Monday's game. "The hamstring, yes, he needs [time off] because I think he's doing everything he can with it, to be honest," Rivers said. "The two days are huge for us and him. It's funny: We go into the series talking about J.J. and Jamal and we left the game last night thinking we need two days for CP. So these two days will be good for him." Paul said on Monday that he intended to play through the discomfort. "Only thing I couldn't play through was the shoulder thing," Paul said of the separated shoulder that cost him six weeks in January and February. "This is fine."
