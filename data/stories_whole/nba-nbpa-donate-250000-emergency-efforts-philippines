NEW YORK -- The NBA and NBA Players Association are donating $250,000 to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF in support of UNICEF's emergency relief efforts in areas of the Philippines ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan. Also, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, whose mother is from the Philippines, will appear in a public service announcement for the organization to help raise funds for the relief efforts. The NBA said Sunday in a release that estimates show as many as 4 million children could be affected by the disaster that has killed thousands and could be the deadliest natural disaster on record. The league also is planning a second donation to another organization and is encouraging others to help the efforts in the Philippines, where it played an exhibition game last month between Houston and Indiana.
