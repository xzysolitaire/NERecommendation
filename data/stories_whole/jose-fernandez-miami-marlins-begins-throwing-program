MIAMI -- Marlins ace Jose Fernandez is throwing again, 4Â½ months after he underwent season-ending Tommy John elbow surgery. Fernandez made 25 throws of 30 feet -- half the distance from the mound to the plate -- and said he felt great after the brief workout Wednesday at Marlins Park. The 2013 National League Rookie of the Year was cleared last week to begin a throwing program. Fernandez underwent surgery May 16 and hopes to return around midseason in 2015.
