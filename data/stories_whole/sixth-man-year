There are many worthy candidates for the Sixth Man of the Year award this season. At the top of the list are Chicago's Taj Gibson and the L.A. Clippers' Jamal Crawford. Our panel thinks Gibson should take home the honors, but sees Crawford actually winning the award for the second time in his career. Gibson has been a key player in keeping Chicago's bench a strong point, shouldering more responsibilities for a playoff-bound team that traded Luol Deng midseason and dealt with the ongoing injury problems of Derrick Rose. Meanwhile, Crawford continued to thrive in his sixth-man role with the Clippers, and also stepped in admirably as a starter when his teammates went down with injuries. Here is the voting breakdownÂ by our ESPN Forecast panel. ESPN Forecast: Most Valuable | Coach of Year | Rookie of Year | Defensive POY | Most Improved | Sixth Man
