OKLAHOMA CITY -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Matt Barnes is expected to miss a minimum of two weeks after suffering a retinal tear in his left eye, the team announced Thursday. Barnes was hurt on Monday against the Memphis Grizzlies, and underwent a surgical procedure Tuesday to repair the retina. The Clippers were in Oklahoma City on Thursday to play the Thunder. Barnes did not make the trip. "I talked to him right before we went out," said coach Doc Rivers. "Obviously disappointing news. We thought we were going to catch a break yesterday afternoon when the swelling was going down. We thought that was great news but I got the call it was the exact opposite. We have to play. We love Matt but everybody gets paid on our team. Nobody's doing it for free. Somebody's going to have to step up. Reggie [Bullock], we'll do something. We cover for each other. That's how you do it." Barnes has appeared in eight games this season, averaging 5.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 20.0 minutes per game. "We have to rally. Matt is a big piece to our team," said Chris Paul. "We want him to get healthy as soon as possible but no rush. It's big picture for us. We want Matt back healthy whenever that may be."
