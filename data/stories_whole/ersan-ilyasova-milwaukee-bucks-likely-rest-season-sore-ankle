MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Bucks say forward Ersan Ilyasova is likely to miss the rest of the season because of a sore right ankle. The Bucks say a specialist in Los Angeles examined Ilyasova's ankle on Tuesday and instead of surgery recommended rest and rehabilitation. The team made the announcement Thursday. The team says based on that recommendation, Ilyasova is not expected to play again this season. In 55 games, 47 of them starts, Ilyasova has averaged 11.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 26.9 minutes.
