Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant was drafted directly out of high school in 1996, so he never had the opportunity to experience college life first-hand. The injured superstar took the time to rectify that Thursday night. While traveling with the Lakers, who face the Boston Celtics on Friday, Bryant sat in on a class at Boston College. No word yet on Bryant's class participation grade, though he certainly was a hit with his temporary classmates.
