The Suns didn't make the playoffs, but there's a good chance they'll be rewarded for their strong 2013-14 during award season. Our panel sees Phoenix point guard Goran Dragic earning this year's Most Improved Player award after igniting the Suns to an unexpected playoff push this season. Dragic averaged a career-high 20.3 points per game, hit career highs in field goal shooting (50.5 percent) and 3-point shooting (40.8 percent) and helped lead a Suns team that finished at the bottom of the West last season. New Orleans' Anthony Davis, who made his first All-Star Game this season, was second in our voting; Dragic's teammate Gerald Green finished third. Here is the voting breakdown by our ESPN Forecast panel. ESPN Forecast: Most Valuable | Coach of Year | Rookie of Year | Defensive POY | Most Improved | Sixth Man
