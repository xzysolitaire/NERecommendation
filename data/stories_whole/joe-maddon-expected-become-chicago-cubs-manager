The Chicago Cubs are on the verge of hiring Joe Maddon as manager, as first reported by CBSSports.com. Two sources familiar with the situation confirmed the agreement to ESPN's Jim Bowden. However, three team sources told ESPN's Buster Olney a deal is not yet in place, though they say one is expected. Major League Baseball is sensitive to teams making major announcements during the World Series. The deal will be finalized and announced after the World Series, likely over the weekend, sources told ESPN.com. CBSSports.com initially reported the two sides had reached an agreement, but then reported Maddon was on the verge of a deal. The Tampa Bay Rays announced last Friday that Maddon had exercised an opt-out in his contract, which was due to expire after next season. Maddon managed the Rays for nine seasons, compiling a 754-705 record. He led Tampa Bay to the playoffs four times, won two AL East titles and made one World Series appearance. The Cubs have not made the playoffs since 2008 and have finished last or next-to-last in the NL Central in each of the past five seasons.
