METAIRIE, La. -- New Orleans Pelicans general manager Dell Demps says guard Tyreke Evans has a strained right hamstring that is expected to require about three to five weeks of rehabilitation. Demps says the injury occurred while Evans was playing in a pickup basketball game away from team headquarters last week. Demps says Evans has returned to New Orleans to work with team medical and training staff and hopes to be cleared to play before the regular season opener on Oct. 28 against the Orlando Magic. The 25-year-old Evans is entering his sixth NBA season. He played in 72 games for New Orleans last season, averaging 14.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and five assists in 28.2 minutes per game.
