CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Hornets guard Lance Stephenson has returned to practice and says nothing will keep him out of the season opener Wednesday night against Milwaukee. Stephenson is battling a groin injury and has missed four preseason games. He said Tuesday, "I'm playing" and added that he feels "about 90 percent." Stephenson moved with a pronounced limp as he shot around after practice Tuesday. Coach Steve Clifford says the decision will rely heavily on what the team's trainers decide after Stephenson goes through shoot-around before the game. He says the important thing is making sure Stephenson doesn't suffer a setback. Clifford says Stephenson did a lot of contact drills Tuesday "but we'll have to wait and see how he does. If there's not a lot of soreness then he will play."
