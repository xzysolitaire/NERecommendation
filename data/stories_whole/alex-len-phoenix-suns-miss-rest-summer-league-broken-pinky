PHOENIX -- Suns center Alex Len will miss the remainder of the Las Vegas summer league with a broken right pinky. Len, the fifth pick overall in the 2013 draft, was injured in his summer league debut on Saturday night. This was supposed to be an important summer league for Len as he tries to improve on his spotty rookie season. He missed all of last offseason recovering from surgeries on both ankles. He is to have the finger evaluated in Phoenix on Monday.
