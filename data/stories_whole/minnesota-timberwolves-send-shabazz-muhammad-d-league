MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves plan to send first-round draft pick Shabazz Muhammad to Iowa of the NBA Development League in an effort to get him some more playing time. Coach Rick Adelman says the seldom-used Muhammad will benefit from playing big minutes rather than sitting on the bench for the Timberwolves. The 14th overall pick in the June draft has played in only 11 of Minnesota's 32 games this season. He has yet to play 10 minutes in a game. Muhammad is averaging 1.1 points. He was initially resistant to the idea of playing in the lower league. But Adelman and President Flip Saunders say it's the best thing for his development. Muhammad will likely play at least four games before potentially rejoining the Timberwolves. He averaged 17.9 points in his lone season at UCLA.
