MIAMI -- Al Jefferson is in Charlotte's starting lineup for Game 2 of the Bobcats' Eastern Conference first-round series against the Miami Heat. Jefferson strained the plantar fascia in his left foot in the Bobcats' opening-game loss Sunday, and was put in a walking boot after that game to keep pressure off the sore area. Bobcats coach Steve Clifford said the team will monitor Jefferson -- Charlotte's leading scorer and rebounder -- closely once the game begins. Miami went with its same starting lineup as Game 1. Point guard Mario Chalmers was a game-time decision because of a bruised shin that kept him out of practice Tuesday.
