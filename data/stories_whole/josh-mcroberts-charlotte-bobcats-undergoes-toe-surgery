CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte Bobcats power forward Josh McRoberts had surgery Wednesday to remove bone spurs from his left big toe. The surgery was performed foot specialist Dr. Bob Anderson. The Bobcats say McRoberts will not be allowed to do any basketball activities for at least four weeks. Charlotte's season ended Monday night when it was swept by Miami in the best-of-seven first-round Eastern Conference playoff series. McRoberts had a hard foul in Game 2 to the throat of Heat forward LeBron James and was fined $20,000 by the NBA. McRoberts is due to make $2.8 million next season, but is expected to opt out of the contract to become a free agent.
