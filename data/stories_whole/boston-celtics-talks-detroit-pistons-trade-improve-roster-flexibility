The Boston Celtics traded center Joel Anthony to the Detroit Pistons for guard Will Bynum on Friday. The Celtics made the move with roster flexibility in mind. They have 16 fully guaranteed contracts on their books and must trim that to 15 before the start of the regular season. Swapping Anthony, who is set to make $3.8 million this season, for Bynum, who will earn $2.9 million, saves the team $900,000. It's not clear if Bynum will stick with the Celtics. It could hinge on whether the team makes any additional moves before the season tips later this month. Anthony, 32, had played sparingly, including this preseason, since being acquired from the Miami Heat in January. If the Celtics ultimately elect to waive Bynum, the $900,000 savings from the trade would give them additional flexibility with the goal of staying under the tax line this season.
