ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Hall of Fame shortstop Barry Larkin and former major league outfielder Doug Glanville were added Monday to the list of candidates the Tampa Bay Rays are considering for their next manager. The team announced on Twitter that Larkin and Glanville, both ESPN analysts, were the final additions to the Rays' initial round of interviews, expanding the group to 10. Tampa Bay began searching for Joe Maddon's replacement Oct. 24, when he opted out of the final year of his contract after leading the Rays to four playoff berths in the past seven seasons. Maddon was hired to manage the Chicago Cubs. Larkin was a 12-time All-Star and the 1995 National League MVP during a 19-year career with his hometown Cincinnati Reds. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2012. Glanville played for the Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers during a nine-year career that ended in 2004. He batted .277 with 168 stolen bases. The Rays revealed a preliminary list of eight candidates Thursday: bench coach Dave Martinez, longtime major leaguer Raul Ibanez, former Washington and Cleveland manager Manny Acta, Milwaukee special assistant Craig Counsell, minor league manager Charlie Montoyo, Giants bench coach Ron Wotus, former Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu and Indians coach Kevin Cash.
