CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Grizzlies coach David Joerger says starting guard Courtney Lee will be "out a while" with a concussion. Lee will not play Saturday night at Charlotte, and Joerger said before the game he wasn't sure who would start in his place. Lee was injured in the first half of Memphis's 97-89 win over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night. Versatile reserve Tayshaun Prince played almost 18 minutes against the Pacers and had six points. Joerger says it is possible Vince Carter could see more action against the Hornets.
