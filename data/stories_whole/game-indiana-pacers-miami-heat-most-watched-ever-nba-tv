NEW YORK -- The Indiana Pacers' 90-84 victory over the Miami Heat on Tuesday night was the most-watched game ever on the league's NBA TV outlet. The network says Wednesday that the telecast averaged 920,000 viewers, topping out at more than 1 million from 10:15 to 10:30 p.m. EST. The game, the first since Miami's seven-game victory in last season's Eastern Conference finals, surpassed the 868,000 total viewers that watched a Lakers-Portland game on Oct. 31, 2012. The previous highest game this season came Sunday, when 691,000 watched Kobe Bryant's return for the Lakers against Toronto.
