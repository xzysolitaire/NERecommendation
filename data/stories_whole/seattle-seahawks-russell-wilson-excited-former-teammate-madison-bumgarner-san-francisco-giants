RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson had a former teammate to root for in Game 7 of the World Series on Wednesday night -- San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner, who was named Series MVP after his team's win over the Royals. "We were roommates at the [2007] East-West Showcase coming out of high school for the top 100 [baseball] players [in the nation],'' Wilson said Thursday. "I've gotten to know him over the past few years, but not been in touch with him lately. But we played on the same team and I think we won it all that showcase.'' Wilson hit .467 as a shortstop his senior year at Collegiate High School in Richmond, Virginia. Bumgarner was 11-2 with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts in 86 innings his senior year at South Caldwell High School in Hudson, North Carolina, leading his team to the 4A state championship. "He's a big guy and can really throw it," Wilson said of Bumgarner. "I'm excited for him. I used to play against [Giants catcher] Buster Posey too, so to watch those two guys [win the World Series] was pretty special." Posey, who is from Leesburg, Georgia, played at Florida State in 2008 when Wilson was playing baseball and football at North Carolina State. Bumgarner had committed to play college baseball at the University of North Carolina, but decided to sign with the Giants with they made him the 10th pick of the first round in 2007. "He had a great arm and could throw a lot of pitches, even then," Wilson said. "And he hit pretty good, too, but he's a force out there pitching. We were on the same [all-star] team, so I'm glad I didn't have to hit off him."
