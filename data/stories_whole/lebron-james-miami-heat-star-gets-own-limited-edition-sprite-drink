LeBron James has had limited edition shoes and even a limited edition gum, and now he'll have his own limited edition drink. Sprite announced on Wednesday that it would be releasing Sprite 6 Mix by LeBron James, a drink that features the traditional lemon-lime flavor with cherry and orange. The drink will be available nationwide for a limited time in 19.2-ounce cans and 20-ounce bottles. "I never imagined I would have my own flavor someday," James said in a statement. "I had a great time working with the Sprite team to turn my favorite flavors into a pretty cool variation of one of my favorite brands. I'm proud of what we created and I'm excited for my fans to try it." James has had a deal with the Coca-Cola brand since his rookie season. Sprite is the sixth-largest soft drink in the U.S. by market share, according to trade publication Beverage Digest, with 4.6 percent of the soft drink segment. Only Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Diet Coke and Dr Pepper are larger. Among the biggest brands, Sprite had the biggest volume growth, a 0.6 percent rise, in 2013.
