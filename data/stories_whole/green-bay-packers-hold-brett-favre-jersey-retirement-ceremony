Packers president Mark Murphy thinks the relationship between the organization and former quarterback Brett Favre remains strong, but there are no plans to retire Favre's No. 4 jersey this coming season. "I don't anticipate having him retire a number this season, in a game this year," Murphy said. "We have very good relations and very good communication, but I don't anticipate that this year." However, Murphy would not rule out the possibility that Favre could return for a game this season. The two sides had discussed a possible return last season, but ESPNWisconsin.com reported recently that Favre pulled out in part because he was afraid of the reaction he might receive from the Lambeau Field crowd. "That is an issue," Murphy said. "He doesn't want it, and neither do we. He wouldn't want to come back and get booed. You can't control 80,750 people. I really think as time goes on, every year that passes, it's less likely that he would get booed, but that is an issue." Favre told SiriusXM NFL Radio in June that he wouldn't trade his Packers experience for anything. "It's going to happen, I'll be back up there," Favre told the station about a return to Green Bay. "Again, my career in Green Bay, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It was awesome. The people were awesome, and I just think everything's going to be fine, and in my opinion, it is now. It's just a matter of getting back up there."
