PORTLAND, Ore. -- Houston Rockets forward Terrence Jones has agreed to pay $10,000 to a charitable organization that benefits the homeless in exchange for having a misdemeanor harassment charge dismissed. The 6-foot-9 Jones was arrested outside a Portland, Ore., nightclub last summer after a police sergeant saw him walk by a doorway where two homeless men were sleeping and yell "Wake Up!" before stomping on one man's leg. The civil compromise first reported by The Oregonian newspaper was completed Monday. Jones graduated from Portland's Jefferson High School before attending the University of Kentucky. The Rockets selected Jones in the 2012 draft, and he averaged 12 points this season. He returns to his hometown Friday when the Rockets play the Trail Blazers in Game 3 of their playoff series.
