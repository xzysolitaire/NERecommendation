Los Angeles Lakers draft pick Julius Randle will not require surgery on his right foot, it was determined Wednesday after Randle traveled to Indiana to meet with foot specialist Dr. David Porter. Randle, selected No. 7 by the Lakers in last week's draft, was also medically cleared to play on the Lakers' summer league team in Las Vegas. Randle had a screw placed in his foot to repair the broken fifth metatarsal, located on the outside of his foot, when he suffered the injury at the beginning of his senior season in high school. Porter examined Randle to make sure the screw would not need to be replaced with a corrective procedure this summer. The only issue that needs to be resolved now before Randle can join the team in Vegas is getting the 6-9, 250-pound power forward signed to his rookie contract. There is a moratorium on teams signing players to new deals from July 1-10 while the league is immersed in the initial frenzy of free agency. The Lakers open up their summer league schedule on July 11 against the Toronto Raptors.
