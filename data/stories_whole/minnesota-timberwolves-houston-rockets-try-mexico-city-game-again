MEXICO CITY -- The Minnesota Timberwolves will make their second attempt to play a regular-season game in Mexico City, after last year's game with the San Antonio Spurs was canceled because of smoke inside Mexico City Arena. The Timberwolves will face the Houston Rockets on Wednesday in the same venue where a short circuit in a generator room sent fumes inside the building during warmups. NBA Mexico director Raul Zarraga says "stricter measures" have been taken to "prevent this from happening again." The arena was evacuated about 45 minutes before tipoff. The $300 million glass-clad arena opened in 2012. The last regular-season NBA game in Mexico was on Dec. 6, 1997, when the Rockets beat the Dallas Mavericks 108-106.
