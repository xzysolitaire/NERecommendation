RENTON, Wash. -- It's not surprising to Seattle Seahawks fans to say quarterback Russell Wilson is a good guy, but he has that designation, officially, now. Wilson has been selected as the 2014 Good Guy Award winner by the Professional Football Writers of America (PFWA). He is the first Seahawks player to receive the honor, but the sixth quarterback selected in the last seven years. The Good Guy Award is given to a NFL player for his qualities and professional style in helping pro football writers do their jobs. The award was first given by the PFWA in 2005 to Pittsburgh running back Jerome Bettis. In leading the Seattle Seahawks to their first NFL championship, Wilson was cited for being not only the face of the franchise, "but also the voice and conscience of it." Wilson became only the fourth second-year quarterback and the third-youngest quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl title when the Seahawks beat Denver 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII. During the regular season, he completed 257 of 407 passes (63.1 percent) for 3,357 yards, 26 touchdowns and only nine interceptions as the Seahawks finished 13-3 in winning the NFC West title. He also rushed 96 times for 539 yards and one touchdown.
