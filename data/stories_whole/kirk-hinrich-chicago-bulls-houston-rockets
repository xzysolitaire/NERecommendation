HOUSTON -- Chicago Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich will not play Wednesday night against the Houston Rockets because of back stiffness. "I'd have to improve between now and then, so it's probably not likely," Hinrich said before Wednesday's shootaround. "But it's one of those things where I'm just trying to stay on top of it, get back to work, and play decent to help the team." Hinrich, who has missed the past two games because of back issues, said that he played through pain during much of Friday's win over the Milwaukee Bucks. "The whole second half of the Milwaukee game it was really bothering me. ... I've been getting extra work trying to stay on top of it," he said. "But after the game, my back [was] really locking up, spasming up, and I've just been working on trying to get it right since." With Hinrich out, veteran D.J. Augustin, who had 14 points and eight assists against the Orlando Magic on Monday, and rookie Marquis Teague again will be asked to run the offense. Teague was listed as the starter. Hinrich isn't sure when he will return. "Obviously I'd like to be ready to play tonight," Hinrich said. "If game time was now, I wouldn't be able to play. Just stay on top of it and not ruling anything out. Just keep getting worked on to get better."
