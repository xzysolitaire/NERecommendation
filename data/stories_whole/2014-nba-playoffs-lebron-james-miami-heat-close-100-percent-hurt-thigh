After having eight days off thanks to Miami's first-round sweep in the playoffs, LeBron James is as close to being completely healthy as he's been all season. James, who told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that the last time he felt this healthy was on his honeymoon back in September, suffered a thigh contusion in Game 4 of the Heat's series against the Charlotte Bobcats. James remained in the game, but limped through the third and fourth quarters. He finished with 31 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in 43 minutes. James has used the time off to treat the soreness and expects to be ready to play in Tuesday's opener against Brooklyn. "I'm still getting [treatment] but it's a little behind me," James said, according to the paper. "By Tuesday night, I should be close to 100 percent with the thigh. I've done contact drills and I've done contact days." While occasionally limited, James has participated in each of the six practices the Heat held as they awaited the Nets' series against the Raptors to finish. Brooklyn defeated Toronto in seven games.
