SAN ANTONIO -- LeBron James is the 11th player in NBA history with 1,000 postseason assists. James hit the milestone with his first assist of the NBA Finals, setting up Dwyane Wade for a score with 5:05 left in the first quarter in the Miami Heat's game against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night. James is only the third player in NBA playoff history with at least 4,000 points and 1,000 assists, joining Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. He's also the second forward to reach the postseason assist milestone, with Larry Bird being the other. Since James entered the league, no one has more postseason points, assists or steals than the four-time NBA MVP. Over that span, he also ranks second to the Spurs' Tim Duncan in postseason rebounds. James finished with 25 points, six rebounds and three assists in the game, a 110-95 Heat loss. He left in the fourth quarter with a thigh cramp and did not return.
