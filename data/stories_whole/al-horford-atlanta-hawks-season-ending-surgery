ATLANTA -- Hawks center Al Horford has had season-ending surgery to repair a complete tear of his right pectoral muscle. Tuesday's surgery at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital was performed by Dr. Xavier Duralde and Hawks team physician Dr. Michael Bernot. Horford, who was the Hawks' leading scorer and rebounder, suffered the injury in the first overtime of Thursday night's 127-125 double-overtime win at Cleveland. Horford is averaging 18.6 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. He suffered a similar injury when he tore his left pectoral muscle early in the 2011-12 season. He returned for the playoffs two years ago. The Hawks say Horford will miss the playoffs this season.
