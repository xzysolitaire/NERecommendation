We're keeping track of the teams with the most salary-cap space this summer. Here's how things stand as of June 30 with Miami's Big Three opting out. Check back for updates. NOTE: Maximum salary-cap room is calculated by counting only: Â (A) the players currently under contract, (B) the amount paid to waived players, (C) cap holds for first-round picks; and (D) minimum charges for teams with rosters below 12 players.
