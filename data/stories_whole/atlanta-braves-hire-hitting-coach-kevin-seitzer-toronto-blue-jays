ATLANTA -- The Braves have hired Kevin Seitzer from the Toronto Blue Jays to replace Greg Walker as hitting coach. Atlanta also named Jose Castro as assistant hitting coach. Walker was assisted by Scott Fletcher this season as the Braves finished 79-83. The 52-year-old Seitzer was the hitting coach for Arizona during part of the 2007 season, for Kansas City from 2009-12 and for the Blue Jays this past season. The former All-Star third baseman hit .295 in 12 major league seasons with the Royals, Milwaukee, Oakland and Cleveland. John Hart, who on Thursday was named president of baseball operations, said manager Fredi Gonzalez had a role in the selections of Seitzer and Castro. "Kevin is a well-respected, experienced hitting coach,'' Hart said. "He was a great player and as a coach he has a skill set that will benefit our club. Jose brings a tremendous resume in the hitting discipline. He has been a coordinator and hitting coach for many years and he has a long-standing relationship with Fredi.'' The 52-year-old Castro was the Cubs' quality assurance coach this season. He was Seattle's interim hitting coach in 2008 and has worked as a minor league hitting coordinator and coach in the Montreal, Florida, San Diego and Seattle organizations. Walker resigned after the Braves finished 14th among National League teams, ahead of only San Diego, in runs scored. Fletcher and third base coach Doug Dascenzo also are not returning.
