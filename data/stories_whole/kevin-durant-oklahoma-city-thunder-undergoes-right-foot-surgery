Kevin Durant underwent successful surgery to repair a Jones fracture in his right foot, the Thunder announced Thursday. He will be re-evaluated in six weeks. A Jones fracture is a broken bone at the base of the small toe, something Thunder general manager Sam Presti said is "the most common surgical procedure performed on NBA players as of late." Durant took to Twitter to let fans know the surgery was a success. He also showed his recovery in an Instagram post Thursday night. Following the announcement of the injury last Sunday, the Thunder had said there was a slim chance Durant could avoid surgery following a separate follow-up consultation. However, it was determined by the Thunder, Durant and his representatives to opt for surgery, which includes reconnecting the bones with a screw. The procedure was performed by Dr. Robert Anderson at the OrthoCarolina Foot and Ankle Clinic in Charlotte, North Carolina. Durant's injury was caught very early before it became serious, which has the team optimistic he can return within the original six- to eight-week window. Following practice last Saturday, Durant informed the team he was feeling an "aching" in his right foot. "We're really fortunate that we're catching it when we're catching it," Presti said. "We are very fortunate that Kevin notified us [Saturday] and that we're kind of catching it on the front end, before this became more of an acute issue." With a timetable of six weeks, Durant is set to miss at least most of the first month of the season. Durant, 26, averaged 32 points, 7.4 rebounds and 5.5 assists in 81 games last season. He led the league in minutes played with 3,122.
