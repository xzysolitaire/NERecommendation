NEW YORK -- Chris Young has gone from being the Mets' top free-agent signing a year ago to agreeing to a deal with the Yankees to be their fourth outfielder. Young signed a one-year deal with the Yankees, which the team announced Sunday. The contract is worth $2.5 million plus incentives in place for the 2015 season, sources told ESPN's Buster Olney.Â  Last season, Young was signed by the Mets for $7.25 million, but ended up being released in August after hitting just .205 with eight homers and 28 RBIs in 88 games. The Yankees picked him up on a minor league deal, and he hit .282 with three homers and 10 RBIs in 23 games. Young, 31, will back up the injury-prone Yankees outfield starters, Carlos Beltran, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner. Beltran only played 32 games in the outfield in 2014 because of bone spurs in his elbow. He just had surgery but expects to be the starter in right next year.
