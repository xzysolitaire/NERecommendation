The Colorado Rockies extended a one-year, $15.3 million qualifying offer to Michael Cuddyer on Monday, ensuring they will receive draft-pick compensation if he signs elsewhere this offseason. He has until Nov. 10 to accept the offer. Cuddyer had three separate stints on the disabled list last season due to hamstring and shoulder injuries and was limited to 49 games for the Rockies, finishing with a .332 average, one home run and 10 RBIs. In 2013, his second season with the Rockies, he led the National League in batting with a .331 average with 20 home runs and 84 RBIs. The 35-year-old outfielder, who also has played some at both corner infield positions, has a .279 average, 187 home runs and 753 RBIs in 14 seasons with the Minnesota Twins and Rockies. He was paid $10.5 million in 2014 in the last season of a three-year contract he signed with the Rockies in 2011.
