Paul Molitor met with the Minnesota Twins about their vacant managerial job Wednesday. The meeting was first reported by the Star Tribune.  "Certainly, I understand the organization's desire to try and vet, find the best person, but all things considered and certainly with the family support, it's something that I feel would be a good thing if indeed it did happen," Molitor told KARE 11 (Minneapolis-St. Paul) after his meeting with the team.  Molitor played three seasons (1996-98) with the Twins to cap his 21-year Hall of Fame career. He never has managed in the majors or minor leagues but has coached extensively since leaving baseball as a player. The Twins added him to their staff in October 2013, assigning him supervision of the team's baserunning, bunting, infield instruction and positioning as well as assistance with in-game strategy. In July, he became the team's first-base coach after a hip injury to Joe Vavra, the team's regular third-base coach. Minnesota is looking to replace Ron Gardenhire, who was fired Monday after 13 seasons as manager. The Twins finished this season at 70-92, making Gardenhire just the fourth manager in the game's history to preside over at least four straight 90-loss seasons with the same team, joining Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics (nine), Zack Taylor of the St. Louis Browns (four) and Tom Kelly (four), Gardenhire's predecessor with the Twins. Kelly returned for one more season after his streak, and he retired after an 85-77 finish in 2001. Ryan told the Star Tribune that he is "going to move as quick as I can on the process" but declined to say whom he is interviewing. Boston Red Sox bench coach Torey Lovullo, Chicago White Sox third-base coach Joe McEwing and former Twins player Doug Mientkiewicz also reportedly are being considered for the job.
