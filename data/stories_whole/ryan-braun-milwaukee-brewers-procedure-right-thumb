MILWAUKEE -- Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun has undergone a medical procedure to address a nerve problem near his right thumb. Milwaukee said Thursday that Dr. Vernon Williams of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles administered cryotherapy, a procedure involving the application of extreme cold. Braun is to meet with Williams again Monday; if Braun responds well to the treatment, he will begin swinging a bat to determine the procedure's effect on his swing and pain tolerance. Braun hit .266 with 19 homers and 81 RBIs this year. The 2011 NL MVP missed the final 65 games of the 2013 season for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract.
