ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Two Oakland Raiders cheerleaders have sued the team and the NFL claiming they were subjected to poor working conditions while being paid less than minimum wage. The complaint was filed Tuesday in Alameda Superior Court by Raiderettes identified as Caitlin Y. and Jenny C. on behalf of hundreds of fellow cheerleaders. They claim they were forced to change into uniform in public places, were groped by inebriated men and could be benched from games without pay if they did not meet certain weight and fitness requirements. The team declined to comment. The Raiders were also sued earlier this year by current and former cheerleaders claiming wage theft and other unfair employment practices.
