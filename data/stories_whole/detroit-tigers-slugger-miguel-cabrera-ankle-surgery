DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers say slugger Miguel Cabrera has undergone successful surgery to remove bone spurs in his right ankle and repair a stress fractureÂ to the navicular bone, an injury the team was not aware of previously. The Tigers announced Friday that the surgery was performed by Dr. Robert Anderson in Charlotte, North Carolina, and that Cabrera will be re-evaluated in three months. "It was a surprise, I'd say, for all of us," team president Dave Dombrowski said. "We were not aware [the stress fracture] was there. I'm not sure how long it was there. He did have a couple of screws inserted." Dombrowski did not speculate whether Cabrera would be ready for spring training, choosing to wait for details from the follow-up exam in January. Cabrera dealt with ankle problems during the Tigers' season, which ended with the team eliminated from the American League Division Series by Baltimore.
