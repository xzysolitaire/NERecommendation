Philadelphia Eagles safety Keelan Johnson was arrested Saturday in Arizona following an altercation with a police officer, according to multiple reports. Johnson, who played at Arizona State, appeared in two games for the Eagles in 2013. But his status for this season is unknown after authorities said he pushed a police officer who was on the scene to investigate a bar fight in Tempe. He was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Multiple reports stated that Johnson appeared intoxicated and didn't immediately respond to police officers' requests. "We are disappointed to learn of the arrest of Keelan Johnson this past weekend in Arizona," the Eagles said in a statement. "We are still trying to learn all of the facts that led to his arrest. At this point, it's a pending legal matter and, therefore, we will have no further comment." Eagles players are expected to report to training camp Friday.
