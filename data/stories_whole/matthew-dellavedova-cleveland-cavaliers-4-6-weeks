CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova will be out at least one month with a sprained left knee. The team confirmed Sunday that Dellavedova sprained his medial collateral ligament during the fourth quarter of Cleveland's loss in Portland on Tuesday. Dellavedova, one of the team's best on-ball defenders, has missed the Cavs' past two games and the team said he could be sidelined another six weeks. The Australian gives the Cavs energy off the bench and the second-year guard has become one of Cleveland's most popular players. LeBron James played more point guard with the second unit in Friday's 110-101 win over the Denver Nuggets as the team settled into a rotation that doesn't include Dellavedova. Also, the Cavs said guard Dion Waiters suffered a bruised lower back during the second quarter of Friday's win at Denver. Waiters is listed as questionable for Monday night's home game with New Orleans. Waiters was in Cleveland's starting lineup to begin the season, but has been replaced by veteran Shawn Marion.
