ATLANTA -- NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is praising the way the NBA has handled Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racist comments. Goodell said Tuesday at the NFL owners' spring meeting that his NBA counterpart, Adam Silver, was "being decisive, made the right statements and is doing the right things." Silver banned Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million. NBA team owners will meet June 3, when they could force Sterling to sell the team he has owned since 1981. Three-quarters of the other 29 owners must vote to sustain the NBA's charge against Sterling to force him to sell.
