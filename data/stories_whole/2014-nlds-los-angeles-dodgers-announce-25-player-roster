LOS ANGELES -- Infielder Darwin Barney, outfielder Joc Pederson and reliever Chris Perez were left off the Los Angeles Dodgers' 25-player roster for the NL Division Series against St. Louis. The Dodgers released their roster Friday, hours before they opened the series at home with ace Clayton Kershaw opposing Adam Wainwright of the Cardinals. The team had 12 pitchers and 13 position players. Barney hit .303 in 22 games after being acquired in late July from the Chicago Cubs, where the second baseman won a Gold Glove in 2012. Pederson was a September call-up who was the Dodgers' minor league co-player of the year. Perez had a 4.27 ERA in 49 appearances in his first year with the team. Also not making the roster were reliever Paco Rodriguez, who tossed scoreless relief in 15 of 19 major league appearances, and Roberto Hernandez, who was 2-3 with a 4.74 ERA in nine starts with the Dodgers after being acquired in August from Philadelphia.
