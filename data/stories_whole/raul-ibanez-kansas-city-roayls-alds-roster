ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Raul Ibanez has been left off the Kansas City Royals' 25-man roster for the American League Division Series. Ibanez wasn't included on the roster submitted Thursday before the series opener against the Los Angeles Angels. The 42-year-old began this season with the Angels, who released him in June. Former Angels reliever Scott Downs and infielder Jayson Nix also were left off the Royals' roster, while left-hander Tim Collins made the cut. Los Angeles chose reliever Vinnie Pestano over Joe Thatcher, who hasn't pitched well since his return from a sprained left ankle. The Angels also left off left-hander Wade LeBlanc and 40-year-old infielder John McDonald. Versatile Efren Navarro earned a spot as an Angels reserve. The Angels kept 12 pitchers on their roster, while the Royals have 11.
