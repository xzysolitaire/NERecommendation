The Cleveland Cavaliers are making an 11th-hour push to get Australian guard Dante Exum into Cleveland for an interview and a possible workout, a source with direct knowledge told ESPN. Exum, in New York on Wednesday for Thursday night's NBA draft, said he has worked out for the Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic, who have picks No. 2-4, respectively.  Exum's camp will decide Thursday if they will send him to Cleveland for a quick draft-day visit, a source said. The Cavaliers, who already have All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, are unlikely to take Exum with the No. 1 pick, but he could be an option for the team if it trades down in the draft. They also previously had tried to bring in Exum for a meeting, a source said. Multiple sources have told ESPN that Cleveland has a few offers for the No. 1 pick, including potential trades with the Magic, Celtics and the Utah Jazz, who pick at No. 5. If Cleveland holds on to the selection, it is deciding between former Kansas star Andrew Wiggins and Duke's Jabari Parker at No. 1, sources have said.  Parker told ESPN on Wednesday that he thinks he will go No. 2 to Milwaukee. Wiggins, meanwhile, was optimistic and wanted to go No. 1 to Cleveland. In the past, prospects have interviewed and worked out for teams 24 hours before or even the day of the draft, but it would be unlikely Exum would make the trip to Cleveland without an assurance there is a deal in place for the Cavaliers to take him. If the draft order stays as is, and Parker and Wiggins go in the top two picks, Exum likely will go at No. 3 to Philadelphia or No. 4 to Orlando. The potential curveball would be if injured former Kansas center Joel Embiid, who was projected to go No. 1 before having surgery to repair a stress fracture in his right foot, is back in the picture for the Sixers at No. 3 or the Magic at No. 4.
