WASHINGTON -- Police say former Washington Redskins tight end Fred Davis is wanted in a domestic violence case. District of Columbia Police said Wednesday they are searching for the 28-year-old Davis, who lives in Leesburg, Virginia. He's suspected in a domestic assault that occurred in the early morning hours of June 2 in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, known for its nightlife. Davis was suspended indefinitely by the NFL in February for his second violation of the league's substance-abuse policy. He said he was suspended for taking a supplement that included a banned substance. He says it wasn't for marijuana, which was the reason for his first suspension. A day after his suspension was announced, he was charged in Virginia with driving while intoxicated. Davis played for the Redskins from 2008 to '13 and is now a free agent.
