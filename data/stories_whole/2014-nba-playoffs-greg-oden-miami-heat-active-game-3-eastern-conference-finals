MIAMI -- Greg Oden is on the Miami Heat's active roster Saturday night for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. Oden had been listed as inactive in each of Miami's last seven playoff games. He was active in all four games of the opening-round series against Charlotte, but did not play. His last playoff appearance came April 30, 2009, for Portland against Houston. Oden played in 23 games for Miami this season, making six starts and averaging 2.9 points in limited action. He missed 11 straight games near the end of the regular season while dealing with illness and back issues. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Oden had several strong workouts this week, showing that the back problems were no longer troubling the former No. 1 overall pick.
