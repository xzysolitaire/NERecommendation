MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Timberwolves center Ronny Turiaf is out indefinitely with a fractured right elbow. Turiaf was injured Friday night in Minnesota's victory over Oklahoma City when he took a nasty spill after getting tangled up with Nick Collison. The Wolves initially called it a contusion. But an MRI on Saturday revealed the fracture. Turiaf will not need surgery. But the team says he will be re-evaluated next week before it can determine how long he will be out. It's likely to be at least a few weeks, which puts a dent in the Timberwolves' frontcourt depth. Turiaf was signed to back up Nikola Pekovic. Now rookie Gorgui Dieng will see his playing time increase while Turiaf is out.
