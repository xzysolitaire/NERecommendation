Police are looking into Milwaukee Bucks center Larry Sanders' involvement in an alleged altercation at a nightclub, according to a source close to the situation. Coach Larry Drew announced Wednesday night before the Bucks' game against the Cleveland Cavaliers that Sanders wouldn't play because of a "sore thumb," but also said Sanders is out because of an off-court incident Saturday night that is "under investigation." "I have not seen him yet [tonight]," Drew said. "I don't know much more. You probably know more than I do. I do know that it is being investigated and that's the word I've got." In a statement released Wednesday, the Bucks said the "matter is under investigation and Larry Sanders is cooperating fully." Sanders, 24, signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension during the offseason. He's averaging 2.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 17.5 minutes through the Bucks' first three games. Last season, he averaged 9.9 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.83 blocks.
