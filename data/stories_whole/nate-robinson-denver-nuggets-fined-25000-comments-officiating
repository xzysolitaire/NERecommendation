The NBA fined Denver Nuggets guard Nate Robinson $25,000 on Friday for comments he made about officiating last week after a game in which he was assessed a technical foul. "They hate me, they hate me," Robinson said, according to The Denver Post, after the Nuggets beat the New York Knicks 97-95 on Nov. 29. "I don't know why, but it is what it is. "I already know I've got the target on my back, but I'll play through it.Â I don't care. I really don't. It doesn't bother me none." The reserve point guard, who is averaging 10.2 points and 2.6 assists in 18.7 minutes a game, had 16 points in 18 minutes against the Knicks, one of five other teams Robinson has played for during his eight-plus-year career. He also received his second technical in as many days. "If I get a call, I get a call. If I don't, I don't," he said. "If I get a tech, hopefully it's not in the fourth quarter. Hopefully I don't get any more. But I know I will. It's nothing new for me."
