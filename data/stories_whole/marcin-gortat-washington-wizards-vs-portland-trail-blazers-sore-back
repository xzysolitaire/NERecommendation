PORTLAND, Ore. -- Wizards center Marcin Gortat has been scratched from the lineup just before Washington's game against the Portland Trail Blazers because of a lower back strain. Gortat hurt his back during pregame warmups and left the court wincing. He was helped to the locker room by a trainer. It was the first game he's missed this season. Gortat is averaging 12.8 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. He has 28 double-doubles this season. In Washington's 117-111 overtime loss at Sacramento on Tuesday, Gortat had 19 points and 14 rebounds.
