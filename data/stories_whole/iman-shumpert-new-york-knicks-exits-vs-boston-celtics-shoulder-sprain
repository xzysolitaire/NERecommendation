NEW YORK -- Knicks guard Iman Shumpert suffered a sprained right shoulder in the first quarter of Tuesday's game against the Boston Celtics and did not return. The severity of the injury was unclear. Coach Mike Woodson said after the Knicks' 114-88 win that he wasn't sure how long Shumpert would be out for. Shumpert dealt with shoulder soreness in training camp but has remained relatively healthy throughout the season, playing in every game. If Shumpert were out for an extended period, J.R. Smith or Tim Hardaway Jr. would likely replace him in the lineup. Shumpert suffered the injury with 7:55 to play in the first quarter and did not return to the floor for the second quarter. In other injury news, veteran Knicks forward Kenyon Martin returned after missing five games with a left ankle injury and re-sprained the ankle in the first half. Martin had earlier aggravated the injury against the Indiana Pacers on Jan. 16. "Just overuse," the 36-year-old Martin said. "Been going every day and playing a lot of minutes. Just needed a break. Not one thing happened. Just been fighting through it, fighting through it, fighting through it, and the body lets you know. So at my age, you got to listen." Martin limped to the locker room late in the second quarter. The Knicks said he was available to return. Martin has missed eight games this season due to left ankle issues. His minutes early in the season were limited due to soreness in his ankle. He first hurt it last April. The Knicks also said Beno Udrih was unavailable in the second half of Tuesday's game due to illness.
