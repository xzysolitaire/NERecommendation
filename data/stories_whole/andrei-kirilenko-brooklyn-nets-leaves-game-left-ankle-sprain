Brooklyn Nets forward Andrei Kirilenko suffered a mild left ankle sprain in the second quarter of Sunday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks and did not return. X-rays were negative. "I just rolled the ankle," Kirilenko explained following the Nets' 107-104 overtime win. Kirilenko tweaked his ankle while trying to deflect a pass on defense. He went to the locker room shortly thereafter. He has already missed 31 games due to injury this season -- including a stretch of 25 straight due to back spasms. The Nets play in New Orleans on Monday night in the second half of a back-to-back set, and it would be a surprise if they have Kirilenko in the lineup. "We'll see tomorrow," Kirilenko said of his prognosis. "Usually it takes the next day, and we'll see how it reacts." Kirilenko came in averaging 5.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in 36 games (one start) for the Nets this season, though his contribution often goes beyond the boxscore.
