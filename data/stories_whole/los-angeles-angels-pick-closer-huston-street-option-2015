ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Angels have exercised their $7 million contract option on closer Huston Street. The Angels announced perhaps their easiest offseason decision Thursday. Street was an immediate hit after the Angels acquired the veteran right-hander from San Diego on July 19. He picked up 17 saves with a 1.71 ERA for the Angels, shoring up an inconsistent bullpen and playing a major role in Los Angeles' surge to the majors' best regular-season record. Street saved a career-best 41 games in 2014 between the two teams and also boasted a career-best 1.37 ERA. The 31-year-old right-handed closer has 275 career saves and a 2.82 ERA in 10 seasons with the Oakland Athletics, Colorado Rockies, Padres and Angels. Street and setup man Joe Smith are signed for next year, while seventh-inning specialist Kevin Jepsen is eligible for arbitration. The AL West champions declined their $4.5 million option on reliever Sean Burnett, who missed most of the season after elbow ligament replacement surgery. Los Angeles also returned Rule 5 draft selection Brian Moran to Seattle.
