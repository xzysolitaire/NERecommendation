DALLAS -- Mavericks shooting guard Monta Ellis will miss at least the next two preseason games after suffering a sprained left knee during Thursday's practice. Coach Rick Carlisle said the injury was not serious. "The diagnostic tests did not show any structural damage, which is great news," Carlisle said. "He's got to do treatment and rehab. He's going to miss two games for sure and then Monday we'll update you." Ellis' injury means the Mavs will be without their two leading scorers from last season for Friday's home preseason game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Power forward Dirk Nowitzki will sit out his second consecutive game due to a right hip contusion. Nowitzki participated in the Mavs' Friday morning shootaround, his most extensive work since suffering the injury during Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage. "Our expectation right now is that he will play on Sunday," Carlisle said, referring to the Mavs' preseason game against the Indiana Pacers. Ellis, who averaged 19.0 points and a team-high 5.7 assists last season, was the only Maverick to play in all 82 games last season. He has played in 164 consecutive regular-season games. Ellis' absence means the Mavs will not have their full starting five -- which also features three summer additions in point guard Jameer Nelson, small forward Chandler Parsons and center Tyson Chandler -- on the floor together until their Oct. 17 preseason game in Cleveland at the earliest. "Whatever it is, we'll make it work," Carlisle said. "These guys are all experienced, veteran players that have had to adjust to different personnel all throughout their career. Right now, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to get everybody healthy."
