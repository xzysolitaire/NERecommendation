CLEVELAND -- Shawn Marion knows what it takes to win an NBA championship. The Cavs hope his experience will help them get one. Cleveland signed the veteran free agent forward Tuesday, adding a player with an extensive postseason resume to a team targeting an NBA title. Marion agreed to a one-year contract with the Cavs last month, but the sides didn't make it official until Tuesday. A 15-year veteran and four-time All-Star, Marion won a title with the Dallas Mavericks and wants to get a second in Cleveland. "I'm excited to be a Cavalier," said Marion. "I can see the hunger and mentality of everyone in the organization and l look forward to being a part of it. The goal is to win a championship and that's what I want." Last season, the 6-foot-7 Marion averaged 10.4 points and 6.5 rebounds in 76 starts for the Mavericks. The Cavs believe he can help them offensively and defensively, but more importantly, in the playoffs. He's played in 103 career postseason games -- all starts -- and averaged 14.7 points and 9.1 rebounds. "Shawn brings great versatility, talent and championship experience to the team," said Cavaliers general manager David Griffin, who previously worked with Marion in Phoenix. "He will impact both ends of the floor and his ability to guard multiple positions will be particularly important for us." Marion will likely come off the bench for the Cavs, who were overhauled during the summer with LeBron James re-signing from Miami and the blockbuster trade that brought in All-Star forward Kevin Love. Cleveland has also signed veterans Mike Miller and James Jones, who like Marion, have won titles. Marion has also played for Miami and Toronto. He's one of four players in league history to record at least 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett are the others. Marion was drafted with the ninth overall pick by the Suns in 1999.
