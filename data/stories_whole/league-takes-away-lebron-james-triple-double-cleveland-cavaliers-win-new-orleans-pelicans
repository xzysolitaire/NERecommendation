CLEVELAND -- The NBA has stripped LeBron James of a triple-double. After reviewing film of the Cavaliers' 118-111 win Monday night over New Orleans, the league took away a rebound and assist from James, who initially had been credited with his 38th career triple double -- at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. James finished with 32 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as the Cavs improved to 3-3. The league routinely reviews videotape to maintain the integrity of statistics. With 3:27 left in third quarter, James was incorrectly awarded an assist when he tipped the ball to Tristan Thompson, who passed to Kyrie Irving for a layup. In the fourth quarter, James was given an offensive rebound that should have gone to teammate Mike Miller. League spokesman Tim Frank said the changes have been made to the official box score.
