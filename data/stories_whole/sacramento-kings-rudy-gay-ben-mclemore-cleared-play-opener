SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Sacramento Kings forward Rudy Gay and guard Ben McLemore have been cleared to play in the team's season opener next week. The Kings said Saturday that a CT scan on Gay's jaw showed no fracture. He was injured in the second quarter of Sacramento's 93-92 win over the Los Angeles Lakers in Friday night's preseason finale. The team said McLemore received five stitches above his right eye following a collision with the Lakers' Wayne Ellington in the game in Las Vegas. McLemore also passed a concussion test. The Kings open the season Wednesday against the Golden State Warriors.
