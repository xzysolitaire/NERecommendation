EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants linebacker Jon Beason suffered a right foot injury during the team's OTA on Thursday. Beason was able to limp off the field, but then was carted out of the Giants' indoor practice facility after being examined for several minutes on the sideline. He was taken to the Hospital for Special Surgery for tests and examination, which is standard protocol for the Giants. "I really don't know much about Beason," Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. "It's a foot. He was running across the field, he felt something in the bottom of his foot. We'll see." The Giants re-signed Beason to a three-year, $16.8 million contract in March, including just over $6 million guaranteed, and are counting on the 29-year-old to be a cornerstone of their defense this coming season. He made a big impact on the field after being acquired from the Carolina Panthers in a trade last October, and quickly emerged as a leader in the locker room as well. That leadership will be even more important going forward, with defensive end Justin Tuck -- one of the team's two defensive captains last season -- now a member of the Oakland Raiders. "[Beason is] very important," Coughlin said. "Because of the nature of the player, the man, his attitude, what he brings to the table, his leadership skills." Beason is a three-time Pro Bowler and former All-Pro, but he has also been injury-prone, playing in just five games for the Panthers in 2011 and 2012 combined. Devon Kennard, drafted late in the fifth round out of USC last month, immediately replaced Beason at middle linebacker with the first unit.
