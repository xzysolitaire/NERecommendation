PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford practiced with the team Friday and returned to the lineup Saturday against the Sacramento Kings. Crawford was sidelined the past five games with a strained left calf. It was the same injury that sidelined him for eight of nine games last month. Crawford was originally listed a "game-time decision" for Saturday but played for the first time since March 29. "I think it's huge from a chemistry standpoint to get everybody back healthy," Crawford said. "At that point we'd just be missing Danny [Granger]. Just to get back into rhythm after missing some [time] would be huge. You want to play your best heading into the playoffs." Granger, who has missed the past six games with a strained left calf, shot with the team on Friday and is hoping to return for the team's playoff opener next week. Coach Doc Rivers last week thought Crawford and Granger would be out until the playoffs started, but with Crawford coming back and Granger on track to return next week, Rivers could have a fully healthy roster for the first time this season just as the playoffs begin. "I think it's great," Rivers said. "I think it's great for him and the team."
