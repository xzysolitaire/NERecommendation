NEW YORK -- Iman Shumpert will miss Thursday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers due to a right shoulder sprain. J.R. Smith will replace Shumpert in the starting lineup. Shumpert hurt his shoulder in the first quarter of the Knicks' win over Boston on Tuesday. The Knicks are listing Shumpert as day to day. The third-year guard dealt with shoulder soreness in training camp but has remained relatively healthy throughout the season, playing in every game before Thursday. Kenyon Martin is also out for the Knicks with a left ankle sprain. Martin has been dealing with left ankle issues for much of the season. He returned on Tuesday against Boston after missing the previous five games but aggravated the injury after nine minutes on the court. Martin has missed eight games this season due to left ankle issues. His minutes early in the season were limited due to soreness in his ankle. He first injured the injury last April. Smith will make his ninth start of the season for New York (18-27). Smith has played well of late, scoring 15.7 points per game on 48 percent shooting. In other injury news, forward Andrea Bargnani has no timetable for his return from a torn ligament in his left elbow. He said he will not need surgery and is confident that he will return this season. Knicks point guard Beno Udrih is unavailable on Thursday due to an illness.
