KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- Former New York Jets quarterback Erik Ainge has all charges against him from a DUI arrest from last summer dropped. The 28-year-old Ainge was arrested by Knoxville police on Interstate 40 in July 2013 and was charged with driving under the influence, violating the implied consent law and a roadway lane violation. All charges were dismissed Friday during Ainge's scheduled appearance at Knox County General Sessions Court. The police officer who made the arrest had moved out of state and was unavailable to testify. Ainge started 37 games between 2004 and 2007 in his college career at Tennessee. He was a fifth-round draft selection by the Jets in 2008. He retired after three seasons because of injuries to his throwing shoulder. He has spoken openly of his struggles with alcohol and drugs.
