TORONTO -- The Toronto Raptors have picked up the fourth-year team options on Jonas Valanciunas and Terrence Ross, guaranteeing their contracts through the 2015-16 season. Valanciunas, a 7-foot-0 center from Lithuania, averaged 10.3 points and 7.6 rebounds in 138 starts in his two seasons since the Raptors selected him fifth overall in the 2011 draft. Last season, Valanciunas led the team in rebounds (714), offensive rebounds (226) and double-doubles (26). The 6-foot-7 Ross, taken eighth by the Raptors in 2012, averaged 8.7 points and 2.6 rebounds in 154 games. He started 62 of the final 63 games last season, and had 51 points on Jan. 25 against the Los Angeles Clippers to tie Vince Carter's franchise record.
