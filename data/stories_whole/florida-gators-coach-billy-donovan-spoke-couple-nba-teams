The Cleveland Cavaliers have contacted Florida's Billy Donovan about their coaching vacancy, sources told ESPN.com. Donovan said Thursday that several NBA teams had called him about openings in recent days but that he still plans to be with the Gators next season. He declined to specify which teams called --Â  Detroit, Golden State, the Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota, New York and Utah also have openings -- and jokingly cited his brief stint with the NBA's Orlando Magic in 2007 as reason for keeping details private. "I have spoken to a couple NBA teams, and that's all I'm going to say," Donovan said. "It's always flattering, but at the same time, I've always said that I'm very happy here and like it here." The Cavs, who have been buoyed after winning the draft lottery this week, have been focusing their search on big-name college candidates in the wake of firing Mike Brown. In addition to Donovan, they have tested the interest of Michigan State's Tom Izzo and Iowa State's Fred Hoiberg, sources said. The Cavs also inquired about UConn's Kevin Ollie before he signed a long-term extension to stay with the Huskies. The team also has researched several former NBA coaches who are currently available, including Lionel Hollins and George Karl, sources said. The Cavs also reached out to the Los Angeles Clippers seeking permission to interview assistant coach Alvin Gentry, a source told The Associated Press. Donovan just finished his 18th season at Florida, where he has won two national championships and made four Final Four appearances. He says NBA interest is "always flattering," but added, "I'm very happy here and like it here."
