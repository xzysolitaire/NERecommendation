DALLAS -- Houston center Dwight Howard has been fined $25,000 for throwing the ball into the stands late in the Rockets' loss in Dallas. Howard tossed the ball into the seats while turning toward the court, drawing a technical foul with 2:54 remaining in the game Wednesday night. The NBA announced the fine Thursday. The Rockets were ahead 116-111 at the time, and Dirk Nowitzki made the free throw to get Dallas within four. The Mavericks, who trailed by 18 in the third quarter, later went on a 9-1 run to end the game and earn a 123-120 come-from-behind win. Howard had a season-high 33 points and 11 rebounds.
