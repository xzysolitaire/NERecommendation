SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Sacramento Kings have signed forward Royce White to a 10-day contract. The Kings on Thursday assigned White to the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League. White was drafted 16th overall by Houston in 2012 but never played for the Rockets after the sides couldn't find common ground on how to treat his anxiety disorder, which includes a fear of flying. He missed training camp and was suspended by the Rockets in January 2013 after he refused to accept another assignment to Rio Grande Valley of the D-League. The Rockets traded White to Philadelphia in July. He played for the 76ers in the preseason before being waived. The former Iowa State standout averaged 11.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 16 games with Rio Grande Valley.
