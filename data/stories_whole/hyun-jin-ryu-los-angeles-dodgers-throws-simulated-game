LOS ANGELES - According to the Los Angeles Dodgers, left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu threw a 45-pitch, three-inning simulated game Wednesday without incident, which could line him up to pitch Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers have not officially announced any of their starters for the series. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny has already announced his top four starters in the series: Adam Wainwright, Lance Lynn, John Lackey and Shelby Miller. Ryu's simulated game and the rest of the Dodgers' workout Wednesday was closed to the media, likely to keep St. Louis in the dark about Ryu's availability. The Dodgers have withheld probable starters until the last minute routinely this season and often have publicly downplayed the severity of injuries as long as possible, including a strain to ace Clayton Kershaw's upper back in April. "Ryu was at his normal velocity and used all his pitches with no problems before, during or after with his shoulder," the team's statement read. "He will be re-examined [Thursday] to determine how the shoulder responded." Ryu faced Dodgers hitters, including Matt Kemp, Yasiel Puig, Andre Ethier, Carl Crawford and Dee Gordon, the team said. On Tuesday, Ryu said he was confident he would be able to make his next scheduled start. Ryu hasn't pitched since he had to leave his Sept. 12 start at AT&T Park after the first inning with a sore left shoulder. He also missed most of May with the same injury. This time, Ryu received a cortisone injection in an effort to accelerate his recovery entering the playoffs.
