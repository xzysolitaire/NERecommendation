RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- Kyrie Irving is likely going to miss the Cleveland Cavaliers' preseason game with the Miami Heat on Saturday because of a sprained right ankle, but he's happy the result wasn't worse. Irving described a freak play during practice Tuesday where he collided with teammate Anderson Varejao, and Varejao stepped on Irving's foot, causing him to collapse. The Cavs were concerned enough with the injury that they sent him for X-rays and an MRI, which showed no damage. "It was crazy how it happened, I'm just glad I'm doing OK now," Irving said Thursday. "I'm just going to get ice and as much treatment as I can." Irving said he and Varejao misread a play and both ended up in the same spot at the same time. "We're still getting used to each other," Irving said. "LeBron saw me then Andy saw Bron's eyes, so we went to the same position. I was looking dead at LeBron, I don't know what Andy was doing. No, I'm joking, it was just a freaky play that happened." Irving was wearing a walking boot Wednesday but was out of it by Thursday. He took part in a clinic for Brazilian children in the afternoon but sat out much of practice. He's technically day-to-day and hasn't officially been ruled out of Saturday's game, but all signs point to him missing some time. "Right now, I'm probably not playing," Irving said. "I'm just glad I'm doing OK now, and I can still be here with the team."
