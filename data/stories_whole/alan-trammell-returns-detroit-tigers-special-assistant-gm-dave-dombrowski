Former longtime Detroit Tigers shortstop Alan Trammell has been named a special assistant to team president, CEO and general manager Dave Dombrowski, the club announced Monday. Trammell will assist in on-field duties at the major and minor league levels, be involved in all personnel meetings, travel throughout the minor league system and participate in community relations. "I am very excited to be back on board with the Tigers," said Trammell, 56. "It is an honor to return to Detroit and I am looking forward to working with Dave and contributing to the organization." Trammell joins the Tigers after spending the previous four seasons as the bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Prior to his time in Arizona, Trammell was the bench coach for the Chicago Cubs from 2007 to '10, where he was part of back-to-back National League Central division titles in 2007 and '08. He was the manager of the Tigers from 2003 to '05 (going 186-300) and served as the club's hitting coach in 1999. In between his stints in Detroit, Trammell served as the first-base coach of the San Diego Padres from 2000 to '02. "On behalf of ownership and the Detroit Tigers organization, we're thrilled Alan Trammell has returned to the ballclub," Dombrowski said. "Tram will forever be revered as one of the greatest Tigers ever ... and we view this as an opportunity to add an outstanding baseball person who offers a wealth of experience and perspective from his 20-plus seasons, all with the Tigers, and his most recent years of managing and coaching. It's great to have him back." Trammell spent his entire 20-year playing career with the Tigers, hitting .285 with 185 home runs and 1,003 RBIs. He was a six-time American League All-Star, a three-time AL Silver Slugger and earned four AL Gold Gloves at shortstop. He joined Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Al Kaline as the only players to play 20 or more seasons with the Tigers. He was named MVP of the 1984 World Series after hitting .450 (9-for-20) with two home runs and six RBIs as the Tigers defeated the Padres in five games. Trammell finished second in AL MVP voting in 1987 after finishing the season with a .343 batting average, 205 hits, 28 home runs and 105 RBIs.
