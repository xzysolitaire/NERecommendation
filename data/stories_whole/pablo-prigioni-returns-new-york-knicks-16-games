NEW YORK -- Point guard Pablo Prigioni returned to the lineup for the New York Knicks on Monday, scoring two points and grabbing five rebounds in 19 minutes after starting in the backcourt alongside Raymond FeltonÂ in a 103-80 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. Prigioni's return forced power forward Andrea Bargnani to the bench and moved Carmelo Anthony from small forward to power forward for the Knicks (15-26), who lost their fourth straight. Last season, the Knicks were 15-1 in the regular season when Felton and Priogini started in the backcourt. "They haven't played much this year together but last year was fantastic," coach Mike Woodson said before tipoff on Monday. "... We knew last year it worked. But again we haven't see it a lot this season based on injuries." Prigioni missed the past 16 games with a broken toe. Felton missed 16 of the Knicks' 40 games due to injury. Prigioni's move to the starting lineup breaks up the Knicks' frontcourt of Tyson Chandler, Anthony and Bargnani -- for at least one game. Throughout the season, Woodson has been committed to playing a more traditional lineup with Chandler, Anthony and Bargnani on the front line. That trio has struggled together in limited minutes. In 173 minutes together, the Bargnani-Anthony-Chandler front line has been outscored by 7.2 points per 48 minutes. Anthony played primarily at power forward last season, when he led the NBA in scoring at 28.7 points per game. This season, he has split time between small forward and power forward. Woodson acknowledged on Sunday that the smaller lineup may help the Knicks' shooting and help Anthony. "That was kind of us last year with all the shooters and how we spread it and had Melo at the 4. So we'll see how it goes," he said.
