CHICAGO -- Bill Mueller has resigned as hitting coach of the Chicago Cubs, but don't expect Manny Ramirez to be the one filling his shoes, a source told ESPNChicago.com. A source close to the situation said the Cubs are already close to hiring a replacement for Mueller, whose resignation, a source said, came just more than a week after assistant hitting coach Mike Brumley was dismissed.Â  Ramirez received positive reviews from his stint with Triple-A Iowa this season, but a source said Ramirez isn't under consideration for Mueller's job. However, the source said Ramirez could be in the mix for the assistant hitting coach position. Cubs president Theo Epstein has said he's waiting on Ramirez to officially retire before commenting on any future he has as a coach. Ramirez, through his agent, turned down a request for an interview. The Cubs, who led the majors in strikeouts and ranked 28th in on-base percentage this season, will be hiring their fourth hitting coach since 2012. Mueller and Brumley were hired last winter after the Cubs fired most of their coaching staff. Mueller won a batting title with the Boston Red Sox and had a career .373 on-base percentage before moving on to the Los Angeles Dodgers' front office. He was entrusted with overseeing the debuts of several top Cubs prospects this season. The Cubs said Sept. 30 that all coaches, except for Brumley, would be invited back next season. Mueller, however, decided to move on, according to the source, as he liked the comfort zone he had developed with Brumley.
