The Minnesota Wild activated goaltender Josh Harding off injured reserve Monday, but subsequently placed the 30-year-old netminder on waivers. The team announced the news via its official Twitter account Monday morning. Harding has yet to play a game during the 2014-15 season after suffering a preseason injury that occurred when he kicked a wall and broke his right foot, according to a September report from the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Harding was suspended by the Wild after the incident, leaving 24-year-old Darcy Kuemper as the team's starting netminder. Kuemper is 8-5-0 this season with a 2.03 goals-against average and a .914 save percentage. Harding missed extended time last season while battling issues stemming from his multiple sclerosis. He is in the last season of a three-year, $5.7 million contract, though Monday's development casts doubt on whether his NHL career will continue. The Wild have won three straight games following Sunday's 4-3 overtime win against the Winnipeg Jets.
