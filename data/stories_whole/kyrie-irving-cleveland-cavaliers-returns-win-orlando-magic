Kyrie Irving made his return to the starting lineup against the Orlando Magic, finishing with 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds in the Cavaliers' 119-98 win on Wednesday night. The All-Star guard had missed the past eight games with a biceps injury. Irving practiced with his Cavaliers teammates for the first time in two weeks Tuesday and took some contact during his first workout since straining a left biceps tendon March 16 against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Cavs have won five of their last six and are trying to catch Atlanta for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot.
