CHICAGO -- Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose is progressing in his rehabilitation, and the team expects him to return at 100 percent, general manager Gar Forman said Thursday night. "He's making great progress," Forman said on ESPN Chicago 1000's "GameNight." "When he had the injury, we were very lucky that the meniscus could be repaired. He'll come back and be 100 percent -- there's no question in any of our minds. But because it was able to be repaired, he'll have great stability in that knee and it will take away the chances that it becomes arthritic towards the end of his career." Rose was ruled out for the season after having surgery to fix the meniscus tear in his right knee Nov. 22. Forman again made it clear that Rose will not be back this season when asked Thursday night about the chances of Rose returning to play for the Bulls during the postseason. "Our stance hasn't changed at all," Forman said. Rose missed all of last season while recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee and was able to play in only 10 games this season before sustaining the second major knee injury of his career. Still, Forman remains confident Rose will come back at an elite level when he returns next season. "Let's face it, he's still only 25," Forman said. "He's still got 10, 12, 15 years ahead in his career, so everything went as we wanted it to and he continues to make great progress. There's been no setbacks, and we see him returning at 100 percent." The Bulls are hopeful Rose will be able to participate as part of Team USA's World Cup of Basketball squad that will play in Spain this summer.
