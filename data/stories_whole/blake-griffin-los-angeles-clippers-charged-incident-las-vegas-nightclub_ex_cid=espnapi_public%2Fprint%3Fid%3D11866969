Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin has been charged with one count of misdemeanor battery for an incident in a Las Vegas nightclub last month. According to the filing Wednesday in the Clark County District Attorney's office, Griffin "wilfully and unlawfully used force or violence" on Oct. 19 on Daniel Schuman, squeezing Schuman's hand and shoulder and/or slapping him on the face. According to reports at the time of the incident, Griffin was upset by camera flashes in his face and grabbed Schuman's phone. Teammates DeAndre Jordan and Chris Paul were with Griffin at the club that night but were not involved in the alleged incident. According to police, the maximum penalty if convicted is six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. Court records obtained Wednesday show Griffin is due for arraignment Dec. 8 before a Las Vegas justice of the peace. Team spokesman Seth Burton says the Clippers are aware of the complaint but have no immediate comment. Clippers coach Doc Rivers commented on the situation last month, saying: "I trust Blake 100 percent. He's a great kid. We'll figure it out and get through it." Rivers added: "I can't say much, but I feel very confident things will work out."
