The NFL suspended Redskins safety Tanard JacksonÂ again for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. The indefinite suspension, the second one he has received since 2012, will begin immediately, the NFL announced. It's the fourth time he's been suspended since joining the NFL as a fourth-round draft pick in 2007. And it's the third time he has received at least a one-year suspension. He was suspended twice in Tampa Bay, the second time for a year. Then, on Aug. 31, 2012, Jackson, who was in line to start for the Redskins, was suspended indefinitely. He was reinstated earlier this offseason after missing two seasons. "A lifestyle change is necessary anytime you're in a position like that," Jackson said in May. He called his 2012 suspension and subsequent absence from the game a "humbling experience." "It was something I did and something I had to face the consequences for. I like to put it behind me," Jackson said. "It wasn't hard to grasp that I put myself in this position and I need to work and if wanted it back it was going to take some work." When Jackson returned, the coaches were upbeat, although several in the organization cautioned about expecting a whole lot from him. He was clearly behind Ryan Clark on the depth chart at free safety. As spring practices unfolded, their praise of Jackson was more muted.
