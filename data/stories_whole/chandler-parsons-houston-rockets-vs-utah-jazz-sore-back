SALT LAKE CITY -- Rockets forward Chandler Parsons, Houston's second-leading scorer, is sitting out against the Utah Jazz with a sore back. Parsons has been bothered by his back for several weeks and had spasms near the end of the Rockets' win over San Antonio on Saturday. Parsons, who is averaging 17.2 points per game, did not participate in the team's shootaround Monday morning and was a game-time decision. He has had back-to-back 20-plus scoring games and had 24 points to lead the Rockets over the Jazz 104-93 on Nov. 2. Francisco Garcia got his first start of the season in Parsons' place.
