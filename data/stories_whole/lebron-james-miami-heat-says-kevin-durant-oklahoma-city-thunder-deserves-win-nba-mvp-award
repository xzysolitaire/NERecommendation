MIAMI -- Four-time winner LeBron James says Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant deserves the NBA's MVP award. It's expected that the Thunder star will be announced as winner this week. James has lauded Durant's play this season several times recently and did so again Monday. "Much respect to him and he deserves it," James said. "He had a big-time MVP season." James has won the award the past two seasons and in four of the past five -- twice each with Miami and Cleveland. Chicago point guard Derrick Rose interrupted James' run in 2010-11.
