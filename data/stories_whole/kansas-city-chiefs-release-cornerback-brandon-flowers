KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Cornerback Brandon Flowers, a six-year starter, was released by the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday. Flowers played in his first Pro Bowl last season. Flowers had been absent from the Chiefs' offseason practices this year, indicating he was unhappy playing in Kansas City. The Chiefs shifted him to nickelback last season in obvious passing situations. Marcus Cooper, the third cornerback last season as a rookie, has replaced Flowers in the starting lineup during offseason practice. Flowers had been a solid player for the Chiefs until 2013, when he had perhaps his worst season despite making the Pro Bowl. New general manager John Dorsey favors bigger cornerbacks and the 5-foot-9 Flowers struggled in the Chiefs' new defensive system, which often called for Flowers to cover bigger and more physical receivers. "We appreciate Brandon's contributions to the team over the last six seasons," Dorsey said in a statement. "It's in the best interest of the club and the player to part ways at this time. We wish him nothing but the best as he continues his career." Flowers commented on his release on Twitter. The Atlanta Falcons already have expressed interest in Flowers, a source confirmed to ESPN.com's Vaughn McClure.
