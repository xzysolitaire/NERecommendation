INDIANAPOLIS -- Prosecutors in Indiana have formally charged former No. 1 NBA draft pick Greg Oden with battery for allegedly punching his ex-girlfriend in the face during a fight. The free-agent center was charged Monday with felony battery resulting in serious bodily injury, misdemeanor domestic battery, and misdemeanor battery resulting in serious bodily injury. The 26-year-old was arrested at his mother's suburban home in Lawrence, Indiana, on Thursday and released later that day from jail. An affidavit says a witness told police Oden punched the woman in the face, drawing blood. The Associated Press left a phone message seeking comment with Oden's attorney. The Portland Trail Blazers made Oden the top pick in the 2007 draft. He played for the Miami Heat last season.
