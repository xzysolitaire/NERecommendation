Golden State Warriors center/forward Marreese Speights was arrested early Tuesday morning in St. Petersburg, Florida, on a charge of driving under the influence hours after he turned 27 years old. According to the online arrest record on the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office website, Speights was arrested at 3:31 a.m. ET on Tuesday. He has been released on $500 bond. Officer Derek Lang told the Bay Area News Group that Speights took two breathalyzer tests, registering blood alcohol content levels of .103 and .106. Florida law considers a driver impaired at 0.08. The 6-foot-11, 270-pound Speights averaged 6.4 points and 3.7 rebounds per game last season, his first with the Warriors. He signed a three-year, $10.97 million contract with Golden State in 2013. Speights, who played collegiately at Florida, has averaged 7.5 points per game in six NBA seasons. The Warriors said in a news release that the team was aware of the arrest but had no comment.
