METAIRIE, La. -- The New Orleans Pelicans have signed veteran small forward John Salmons to a free agent contract. Salmons, whose acquisition was announced by the club Tuesday, has played 12 seasons in the NBA. He has averaged 9.4 points, 3 rebounds and 2.5 assists during his career. The 34-year-old Salmons entered the NBA with Philadelphia after being selected 26th overall in the 2002 draft. He has twice played with Sacramento and also spent time with Chicago, Milwaukee and most recently Toronto. Salmons, 6-foot-6, has appeared in 874 games with 429 starts. The Pelicans have been looking to add depth at small forward since Al-Farouq Aminu left for Dallas in free agency this offseason.
