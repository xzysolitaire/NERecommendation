LOS ANGELES --Â Glen "Big Baby" Davis has re-signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, sources confirmed Thursday. Davis' deal is for one season at the veteran minimum of $1.2 million. It's a slight pay cut from the $1.4 million he was due to make next season with the Clippers before he opted out with the hopes of signing a more lucrative, long-term deal. At the end of last season, Davis said his preference was to return to the Clippers. Davis came to the Clippers after the trade deadline on Feb. 24, when the Orlando Magic bought out the veteran power forward from the final two years and $12.6 million left on his contract. The move reunited Davis with Doc Rivers, who coached him with the Boston Celtics from 2007 to '11, including on the 2008 championship team. Davis played in 23 regular-season games with the Clippers, averaging 4.2 points and 3 rebounds in 13.4 minutes per game. He averaged 3.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 12.2 minutes per game during the postseason. Davis also made headlines on March 29 when Rivers sent him back to the locker room when the two exchanged words after the coach benched him during a game against the Houston Rockets. The two downplayed the incident after the game. The re-signing of Davis and the signing of free-agent center Spencer Hawes to a four-year, $23 million deal gives the Clippers some much-needed frontcourt depth behind Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, which was a top priority for the team entering the offseason. The Los Angeles Times first reported the deal for Davis.
