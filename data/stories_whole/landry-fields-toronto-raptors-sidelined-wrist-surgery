TORONTO -- Raptors forward Landry Fields will be sidelined for several weeks after having surgery on his right wrist. The Raptors said it was a "minor surgical procedure" to an issue with the ulnar nerve in his hand. Fields underwent ulnar nerve transposition surgery in November 2012 to alleviate nerve compression in his right elbow. The 25-year-old is expected to return to light practicing in three weeks. Fields has appeared in 23 games with one start this season, averaging 2.4 points, 2.2 rebounds and 11.9 minutes.
