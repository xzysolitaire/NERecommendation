CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- An MRI on Kemba Walker's shoulder was negative, and the Bobcats point guard played Wednesday night against the Toronto Raptors. Walker injured his shoulder Tuesday night against the New York Knicks when he ran into Metta World Peace during Charlotte's victory. Walker had X-rays at the arena and returned in the second half. Center Al Jefferson missed his fourth game Wednesday for the Bobcats because of an ankle injury, but coach Steve Clifford said he could return Friday night when the team hosts the Knicks.
