Hoping to pack the house for the Friday night of All-Star Weekend, the Brooklyn Nets are selling that night's ticket as part of a miniplan. Fans who want to go to the BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge, which features the top first- and second-year players in the league, can get that ticket only by buying what the Nets are calling the Rising Stars 6 Pack. The package, which includes the Feb. 13 All-Star Friday ticket, also has games against the Cleveland Cavaliers (Andrew Wiggins), Milwaukee Bucks (Jabari Parker), Orlando Magic (Aaron Gordon), Boston Celtics (Marcus Smart) and Philadelphia 76ers (Nerlens Noel). The package will go on sale Monday even though dates aren't known because the NBA schedule hasn't been released. "We feel like this is a great and creative way to do our part to fill our arena on that night," Barclays Center and Nets CEO Brett Yormark said. "No one has ever sold it this way before." The one wild card could be the Cavaliers game, as Wiggins could be traded. Citing league rules, Yormark wouldn't comment on whether fans are buying packages to see the rookies or are locked in to getting those teams. Because teams can't guarantee a certain player for a certain game, fans buying this package likely would get the Cavaliers game regardless of whether Wiggins is on the team. At a minimum of $325 for the six-game package, it could come off cheap if a fan gets tickets to see the Cavaliers, who are favorites to win the NBA title with LeBron James back in the fold. The Nets will share All-Star Game Weekend with the New York Knicks. Friday and Saturday night, which includes the Slam Dunk Contest, will be in Brooklyn. Sunday's game will be at Madison Square Garden.
