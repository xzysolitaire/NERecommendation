SAN ANTONIO -- Spurs point guard Tony Parker was forced to leave with back spasms late in the first quarter of San Antonio's 112-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday night and will get an MRI on Monday. Parker took a hard fall as he drove the lane, landing squarely on his back near the free throw line after being fouled by Memphis' Mike Conley with 7:38 left. Parker remained on the court for about a minute, but rose and continued playing before exiting the game for good with 2:41 remaining in the period. Parker waved for team physician Dr. Paul Saenz as he walked through the tunnel to go back to the locker room. San Antonio general manager R.C. Buford soon followed. Parker's status is unknown, but he is expected to undergo tests on Monday. "They're going to MRI his back [Monday]," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the game. "I'm not a doctor, I don't know." Parker has missed 10 games this season, including San Antonio's game Feb. 6 at Brooklyn with tightness in his lower back. He has had various leg injuries this season, but also sat out seven games for what was listed as "rest." "Hopefully it's nothing," teammate Manu Ginobili said. "He was just sore in his lower back. We just have to hope it's a couple-of-days thing. Of course, we're a different team without him. We need him healthy and strong for the playoffs." Parker was active during his nine minutes against the Grizzlies, shooting 4 for 4 from the field to help the Spurs overcome a lethargic start. After San Antonio missed its first two shots, Parker drove the lane for one of his teardrop shots, worked his way through screens for 21- and 17-foot jumpers and made a pair of free throws as part of a 12-2 opening run for San Antonio. Parker later drove left into the lane, spinning away from Conley and between a closing Zach Randolph to scoop in a layup with 5 minutes left in the first quarter.
