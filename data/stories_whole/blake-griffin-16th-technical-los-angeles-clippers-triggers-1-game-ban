PORTLAND, Ore. -- Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin, guard Chris Paul and guard J.J. Redick did not travel with the team for its final regular-season game Wednesday against the Portland Trail Blazers. Clippers coach Doc Rivers already had planned on resting Redick, but the decision to give Griffin the night off was essentially taken out of his hands Tuesday night when Griffin picked up his 16th technical foul in the first half against the Denver Nuggets, drawing a league-mandated one-game suspension. Rivers later decided to allow Paul to take the night off as well. "Just rest," Rivers said. "[Paul] is banged up a little. J.J. we already told you and Blake can't play." Griffin was given the technical foul when he swung his right arm to try to block Timofey Mozgov's shot with 3:23 left in the second quarter and hit Mozgov's head. Griffin was adamant the hit was unintentional. Rivers thought the technical would be rescinded but it was ultimately upheld by the league on Wednesday. "I was surprised," Rivers said. "For us, honestly, it didn't matter basketball-wise, but financially you lose money and you don't want anybody to have to pay to sit and that's basically what Blake is doing but it's over with now."
