MINNEAPOLIS -- Flip Saunders has always said he wants the Minnesota Timberwolves organization to feel like a family. Next season the coaching staff certainly will. Saunders' son, Ryan, officially joined the staff as an assistant on Tuesday. Ryan Saunders had spent the previous five seasons working in Washington, where he specialized in advance scouting and analytics. Timberwolves GM Milt Newton, who worked with Ryan in Washington, says the younger Saunders was instrumental in the development of young playmakers John Wall and Bradley Beal. Newton says Saunders' work in player development and analytics will be key in Minnesota. Ryan Saunders joins Sam Mitchell, Sidney Lowe and David Adelman on the staff. Adelman, a promising and well-respected young assistant himself, is the only holdover from Rick Adelman's coaching staff.
