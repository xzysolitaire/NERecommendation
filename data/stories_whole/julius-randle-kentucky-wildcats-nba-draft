Kentucky freshman Julius Randle will leave school after one season in a move that was anticipated prior to the start of the year, multiple sources told ESPN. However, Randle disputed that on Twitter later Wednesday, tweeting: The 6-foot-9, 250-pound Randle averaged 15 points and 10.4 rebounds per game for the Wildcats, who lost to UConn in the national championship game Monday night. Randle had just 10 points and six rebounds in the loss to the Huskies but played well throughout the season and had 24 double-doubles in 40 games, leading UK in both scoring and rebounding. Numerous NBA sources reiterated that Randle is a lock as a top-10 pick and likely will be taken in the top five. The Wildcats have several other players who also could leave Lexington. Fellow freshmen James Young and Andrew and Aaron Harrison are possibilities, as is sophomore big man Willie Cauley-Stein. The NBA draft is June 26 in New York.
