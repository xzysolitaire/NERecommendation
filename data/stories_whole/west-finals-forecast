We asked our ESPN Forecast panel who would prevail in the 2014 Western Conference finals, and it sees the Spurs defeating the Thunder to advance to the NBA Finals for the second season in a row. But it won't be easy, according to the panel. It predicts the Thunder -- who swept the Spurs in the regular season, but are now without Serge Ibaka -- will push the Spurs to seven games. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series. Click here for the East finals forecast Â»
