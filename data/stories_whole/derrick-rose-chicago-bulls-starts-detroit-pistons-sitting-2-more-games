CHICAGO -- After missing so many games over the past three seasons because of various injuries, and missing four of the previous five games because of sprained ankles, Derrick Rose decided to let his play speak for itself. Rose did not speak to reporters after the Chicago Bulls' 102-91 win over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night, but his play told the tale. The former MVP, who had missed the previous two games because of those ankle problems, scored 24 points and dished out seven assists in 32 minutes. After the game, his teammates and coaches sung his praises. "The first half I thought he was great," Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. "It set the tone for us. And then certainly the way he finished was great. A little winded; that's to be expected." Bulls center Joakim Noah said he knows how much it means to his team to have Rose back on the floor. "A lot," Noah said. "Derrick's a hell of a player. It means having your best player on the court, our floor general. It means a lot. When he's out on the court, he demands so much attention and it opens up a lot of easy opportunities for everybody else." Monday marked the first time this season the Bulls' starting five of Jimmy Butler, Mike Dunleavy, Pau Gasol, Noah and Rose played together.  "It's great to have him on the floor because he's a difference-maker," Gasol said. "He's very explosive, gets to the hole, he's a key player for us." The best news for the Bulls was that Rose drove to the rim with more force than he has at any other point this season. He was able to create shots for himself and his teammates throughout the night. "When he's played this year, that's how he's played," Thibodeau said. "He puts a lot of pressure on the defense, so it was good, he's feeling a lot better."
