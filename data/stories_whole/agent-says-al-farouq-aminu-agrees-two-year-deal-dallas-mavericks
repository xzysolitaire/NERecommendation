Forward Al-Farouq Aminu has agreed to a two-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks with a player option for the second season, agent Raymond Brothers said. The Mavs could only offer Aminu, the eighth overall pick in the 2010 draft, the veteran's minimum. The 6-foot-9, 215-pound Aminu, 23, has averaged 6.5 points and 5.5 rebounds in four seasons for the Los Angeles Clippers and New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans. He averaged 7.2 points and 6.2 rebounds for New Orleans last season, when he was primarily a starter. Aminu, who has twice had 16-point, 20-rebound performances against the Mavs, will provide depth for Dallas behind small forward Chandler Parsons and power forward Dirk Nowitzki.
