AKRON, Ohio -- LeBron James and his two sons are getting their hands dirty in helping to rehab a house in the Cleveland Cavaliers star's hometown. James took the controls of a backhoe Monday to help fix up a crumbling house for the family of a sixth-grader in his Wheels for Education mentoring program. His sons -- LeBron Jr. and Bryce -- pitched in to help remove the front steps, a retaining wall and some porch railings under the direction of reality TV show host Nicole Curtis. Work on the house will be featured on Curtis' show "Rehab Addict" on the HGTV network. The Akron Beacon Journal reported that work on the house in the West Hill neighborhood began Sunday. Businesses donated materials and labor for the project.
