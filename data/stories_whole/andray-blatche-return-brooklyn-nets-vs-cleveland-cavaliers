EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Brooklyn NetsÂ center Andray Blatche will play Saturday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Blatche had missed the last four games for "personal reasons." He declined to go into specifics as to what those reasons were. "Now would it be personal if I tell you?" Blatche said before Saturday's morning shootaround. "It's personal reasons. It's over with. The most important thing is I'm back out here playing with my team. That's what's most important right now. And that's something I've been looking forward to since I've been gone." Nets coach Jason Kidd said Blatche would not be subject to any playing-time restriction. "We'll use him as if he's been with us," Kidd said. Blatche worked out at the team's practice facility while he wasn't with them on the road. "I had the trainers here working me out, making sure I wouldn't get out of shape, making sure I'd be ready when the guys got back," Blatche said. Blatche, 27, is averaging 11.6 points and 5.9 rebounds on 45.8 percent shooting in 28 games for the Nets (11-21) this season.
