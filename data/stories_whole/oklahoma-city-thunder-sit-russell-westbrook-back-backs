Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook has been on a minutes restriction since his return in February from knee surgery, and coach Scott Brooks plans to keep the star from playing in some back-to-back situations, too. The Thunder, who haven't played Westbrook more than 31 minutes in the previous 10 games, will play six sets of back-to-back games in the final month of the NBA season. Brooks said Westbrook definitely would sit for some of them. "There's going to be some back-to-backs he's not going to play," Brooks told reporters, according to the Daily Oklahoman. "We definitely have a plan in place." Brooks added that Westbrook's "conditioning is great." "We just want to get some time, while we still can, where he can rest in between games," the coach said. Westbrook is averaging 21.5 points per game this season.
