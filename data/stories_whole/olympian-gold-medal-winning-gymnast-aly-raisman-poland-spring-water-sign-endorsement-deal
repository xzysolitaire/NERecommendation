BOSTON -- Gold-medal gymnast Aly Raisman has signed her first major endorsement deal since returning from the London Olympics. The Needham, Mass., native this week signed a one-year deal to endorse Maine-based Poland Spring water. The 18-year-old Raisman, who won two gold medals and a bronze, says the endorsement was an easy decision because Poland Spring has been an important part of her training regimen for years. Poland Spring officials say Raisman shares the company's goal of being the very best. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Poland Spring is owned by Stamford, Conn.-based Nestle Waters North America.
