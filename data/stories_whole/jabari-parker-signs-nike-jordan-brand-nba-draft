Mere hours before his name will be called in the NBA draft, Jabari Parker has signed a shoe deal with the Jordan Brand. Terms were not disclosed. "We could not be more excited to have Jabari Parker officially join our roster," said Larry Miller, president of the Jordan Brand, which is owned by Nike. "Jabari's character and commitment to excellence makes him a perfect fit with Jordan Brand and we are looking forward to building a legacy with him." Parker was born in Chicago in 1995, just a few weeks before Michael Jordan's most popular shoe, the Air Jordan XI, hit the shelves. NBA players who have a deal with the brand, which did more than $2.2 billion in sales in 2013, include Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Ray Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Parker is the second of the coveted draft picks to sign a shoe deal. Dante Exum signed with adidas in April. Andrew WigginsÂ has yet to sign a high-profile shoe deal. Parker is projected to be taken either first or second at Thursday night's draft in Brooklyn.
