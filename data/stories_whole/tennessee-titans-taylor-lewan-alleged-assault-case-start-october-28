ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- A trial date has been set in the assault case involvingÂ Tennessee Titans rookie offensive tackle Taylor Lewan. Both the prosecution and defense agreed to a trial date of Oct. 28 at 9 a.m. at Michigan's 15th District Court in Ann Arbor, Michigan. If necessary, the trial could continue over to Oct. 29 at 9 a.m. Lewan's attorney, John Shea, has requested a jury trial on the case and jury selection for the case will be Oct. 27 at 1:30 p.m. Lewan will be required to attend both the jury selection and trial. The Titans will be on their bye week during the trial. Lewan is facing one count of misdemeanor aggravated assault and two counts of assault and battery stemming from an early morning altercation on South University Avenue on Dec. 1, 2013. The incident is alleged to have happened following the Michigan-Ohio State football game. Two Buckeyes fans allege they were assaulted by Lewan. The No. 11 pick in the 2014 draft has maintained his innocence the entire time, including at the NFL combine before he was charged. He declined to comment through his attorney Thursday. Surveillance footage made available by a Freedom of Information Act request was grainy and appeared inconclusive as to what occurred that morning. During Lewan's pretrial hearing Thursday, judge Elizabeth Pollard Hines said there were discovery issues, but the prosecution and defense are in the midst of working them out. "There's just always issues, sometimes about what's admissible, what's there, is there more stuff," Shea said. "We want to get as much as there is." The next date in Lewan's case will be a settlement conference on Oct. 23 at 9 a.m. to exchange witness and exhibit lists. Lewan is not required to be present for the settlement conference, but needs to be available by phone or electronic means. During his arraignment, Lewan was ordered to not have contact with the alleged victims and must abstain from alcohol or drug use.
