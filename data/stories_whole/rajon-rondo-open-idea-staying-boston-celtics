BOSTON -- Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo acknowledged recent conversations between his representatives and the team about a possible extension and said he's open to the idea of staying in Boston for the duration of his career. "I like to stick to the script," Rondo said Friday. "I don't like change much. I wouldn't mind staying here the rest of my career. Things don't always seem to go that way, but like I said before, it's just a business. I wouldn't mind extending another 10 years in Boston." Rondo said he believes his agent and Celtics brass talked earlier this month about an extension and said he hasn't thought much about the possibility. Told that Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said Rondo could command "star money" on the open market, Rondo replied, "I'm making star money now, really. It's a pretty good living." Rondo said he'd let his agent handle all the numbers. Ainge said Thursday that the team has talked about a contract extension with Rondo, but the restrictive nature of the collective bargaining agreement at the moment makes it more likely that talks will escalate after this season.
