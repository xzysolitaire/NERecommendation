DALLAS -- The NBA office granted Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's wish, fining him one more time before commissioner David Stern's Feb. 1 retirement. Stern announced Saturday that Cuban has been fined $100,000 for confronting officials on the court and directing inappropriate language toward them at the conclusion of the Mavs' 129-127 loss Wednesday night to the Los Angeles Clippers. Cuban took to Twitter in response to the fine: He added in another tweet that he would donate an equal amount to a charity. Cuban's latest outburst occurred after the Mavs blew a 17-point lead and Clippers guard Jamal Crawford scored the go-ahead points on free throws after a controversial foul call against Dallas forward Shawn Marion. Cuban has said several times this season that he planned to draw the final fine of Stern's 30-year tenure as commissioner. Cuban reiterated that intention to ESPN.com this week before his outburst Wednesday night. This is the 20th time the league has publicly assessed a fine against Cuban since he bought the Mavs in Jan. 2000, including 14 fines that were the result of criticizing officials or interacting with them in ways the NBA deemed inappropriate. Those fines have cost Cuban a total of $1.9 million, plus matching donations to charities of his choice.
