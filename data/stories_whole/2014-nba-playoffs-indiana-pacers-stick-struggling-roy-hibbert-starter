The Indiana Pacers stuck with struggling center Roy Hibbert in their starting lineup for Saturday's Game 4 against Atlanta. Coach Frank Vogel announced his decision a few hours before tipoff. Hibbert, who averaged 10.8 points and 6.6 rebounds a game during the regular season, has floundered in the postseason. He has struggled to cope with an Atlanta lineup that is spreading the court and forcing him away from the basket, which also seems to be affecting his play at the offensive end. He scored only four points in Game 3 in 19 minutes and with only 25 points in the first three games, has yet to block a shot. Vogel said he was thinking of the long-term implications of benching Hibbert so early in the playoffs, especially if the Pacers should advance. "Yeah, it's part of it," the coach said. "We're hoping this is going to be a long haul. Look, you're down 2-1, you're not down 3-0. You won 56 games with the lineup with him as your starting center. And I think you stick with what you do. If it's not working and you have to adjust in-game, we'll adjust in-game." Indiana, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, trails the Hawks 2-1 in the first-round series.
