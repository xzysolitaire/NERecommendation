Some USC fans still have bitter feelings about Pete Carroll's departure. But the Seattle Seahawks head coach will be inducted into the University of Southern California Hall of Fame in 2015, the school announced Monday. The former Trojans football coach is one of 16 people who have been named to the hall's 11th class. They will be introduced at halftime of USC's game against Oregon State on Sept. 27 at Los Angeles Coliseum. Carroll coached at USC from 2001-09, leading the Trojans to two national championships (2003 and 2004), seven consecutive Pac-10 titles (2002-08) and a 97-19 overall record. USC made bowl trips in each of Carroll's nine seasons, winning seven of those games. Carroll left USC after the 2009 season to join the Seahawks, leading the team to a Super Bowl victory in his fourth season with Seattle. Some USC fans criticized Carroll when he left, feeling his decision came before the football program came under NCAA sanctions. Carroll has said repeatedly that was not a factor in his decision. Among the other inductees are former football and baseball coach Jack Del Rio, baseball player Mark Prior and golfer Jennifer Rosales. They were chosen by a 75-member panel of media, previous Hall of Fame members, Trojan head coaches and athletic department senior staff.
