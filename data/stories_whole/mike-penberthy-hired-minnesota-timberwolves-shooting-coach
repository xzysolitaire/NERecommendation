MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have hired Mike Penberthy as a full-time shooting coach to help Ricky Rubio and the rest of the team with their shooting during the season. The Timberwolves announced the hire on Thursday, along with Jason Hervey as a scout and the promotion of Derek Pierce to advance scout. Penberthy played briefly for the Los Angeles Lakers around the turn of the century and spent much of his playing career overseas. One of his biggest priorities will be helping Rubio improve his shooting. The point guard is a career 37 percent shooter and has been working hard to improve that number to take the next step in his career. Penberthy worked with Rubio for a week this summer in California.
