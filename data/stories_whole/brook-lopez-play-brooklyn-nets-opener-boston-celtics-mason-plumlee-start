BOSTON -- Brooklyn Nets center Brook Lopez will not play in Wednesday night's regular-season opener against the Boston Celtics because of a right midfoot sprain. "He's still having some pain when he goes hard," Nets coach Lionel Hollins said at the team's shootaround. Mason Plumlee will start in place of Lopez alongside power forward Kevin Garnett in the frontcourt. Lopez, 26, was expected to miss 10 to 14 days when the Nets announced his original timetable Oct. 16. He could return Saturday in Detroit or Monday in the team's home opener against Oklahoma City. Lopez was limited to just 17 games last season after fracturing the fifth metatarsal of his right foot for the second time in his career. He has had to undergo multiple surgeries on the foot, which has caused plenty of concern about his ability to sustain long-term health. Lopez suffered his latest foot injury when he was stepped on late in the first quarter of an Oct. 15 preseason game in China. Nets general manager Billy King has said he is not concerned about Lopez's foot because it was only a sprain, not a fracture. Brooklyn's offense changes when Lopez, one of the NBA's best scoring bigs, is not available. Plumlee is a different type of player, a high leaper who does most of his scoring around the rim. Plumlee's jump shot remains a work in progress, and Hollins has said he prefers that the second-year pro rather not take any. Plumlee has added a hook shot, which he's shown proficiency with during the preseason.
