MIAMI -- The Dolphins could be without Pro Bowl center Mike Pouncey longer than anticipated. Pouncey is expected to miss the first eight weeks of the regular season after recent hip surgery, the Miami Herald reported, citing a source. Initially, Pouncey had been expected to miss four to six weeks. The Dolphins will begin working on contingency plans at center on Friday when training camp begins. Backups Sam Brenner and Nate Garner are potential replacements. It's also possible that projected starting guard Shelley Smith moves to center. The Dolphins signed veteran free-agent guard Daryn Colledge to a one-year deal after Pouncey's surgery. Miami has had a recent run of bad luck this summer with key players. In addition to losing Pouncey, defensive end -- and 2013 first-round draft pick -- Dion Jordan was suspended four games for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. The Dolphins went 8-8 last season and missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.
