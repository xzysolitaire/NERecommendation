MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins' top pick in the 2011 draft dislocated a finger while diving for a ball in the Arizona Fall League. It's the latest setback for Byron Buxton. It's not clear how much time the outfielder will miss for the dislocated left middle finger. Buxton, 20, was considered to be the top prospect in baseball at the start of the year. He was limited to 31 minor league games this season because of a bruised left wrist during spring training, which he also injured while diving for a ball. The Star Tribune says he also suffered a concussion in August during his only game at Double-A New Britain, where he was scheduled to start the season.
