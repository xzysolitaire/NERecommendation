CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bulls officially announced the signing of veteran combo guard Aaron Brooks on Tuesday. "We're excited to add a player as experienced and talented as Aaron to our group," Bulls GM Gar Forman said in a statement. Brooks split time last season between the Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets -- averaging 9.0 points and 3.2 assists a game. Brooks will serve as a solid insurance policy for Tom Thibodeau off the bench and should be able to play both guard spots. The Bulls have had a history in the Thibodeau era of finding guards that have thrived when given an opportunity, including Nate Robinson and D.J. Augustin over the past two years. As a six-year veteran, Brooks now finds himself in that position as well. Given that Derrick Rose comes into the season having only played 49 games the past three years, Brooks has to be ready to play in case Rose, or veteran Kirk Hinrich, goes down with an injury. The Bulls also officially signed rookie Doug McDermott on Tuesday. The Bulls acquired the Creighton alum on draft night, sending the 16th and 19th picks to the Nuggets in exchange for McDermott and Anthony Randolph. McDermott shined during his first week as a pro, earning first-team Las Vegas Summer League honors. McDermott and teammate Jimmy Butler were selected on Tuesday to be part of the USA Select Team next week in Las Vegas. They will practice against the U.S. national team before it heads to Spain for the World Cup of Basketball, which starts on Aug. 30.
