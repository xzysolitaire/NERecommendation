NEW YORK -- The Rev. Al Sharpton and other civil rights leaders say they've had a "constructive" meeting about racial issues in the NBA with commissioner Adam Silver. The civil rights leaders met with Silver for more than an hour Wednesday in the league's Manhattan offices. Sharpton said they stressed that disgraced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and his estranged wife must never be allowed to have a role in the league. Sterling was banned for life and fined $2.5 million for racist remarks recorded by his girlfriend. Silver worked to oust him as owner of the team until his wife, Shelly Sterling, concluded a deal to sell it to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. The $2 billion deal still needs to be approved by NBA owners.
