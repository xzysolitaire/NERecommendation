Prior to this season, Spencer Hawes was a 31 percent 3-point shooter. But this season, he's hovering close to 50 percent for the Philadelphia 76ers, and on Friday he hit his most memorable one yet, sending their game against the Milwaukee Bucks to overtime. The 76ers' official Twitter account summed up the moment pretty well. The Sixers weren't the only ones getting excited. The 76ers went on to win in overtime. Hawes finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds, his second straight game with at least 25 and 10.
