BALTIMORE -- Kansas City Royals rookie right-hander Yordano Ventura left Saturday's 6-4 win over the Orioles in Game 2 of the ALCS due to tightness in his pitching shoulder. "He's fine," manager Ned Yost said. "I don't anticipate him missing this next start." Ventura was facing Caleb Joseph in the sixth inning when he winced and walked off the mound after throwing a pitch.  After a quick visit from the Kansas City trainer, Ventura left the game and was replaced by Brandon Finnegan. Ventura said afterward he doesn't think he'll need an MRI and plans to make his next start. Ventura exited with the score tied after he gave up four runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked three -- all in the second inning -- and struck out three. Back in May, Ventura was led off the field by a trainer due to a sore elbow in the third inning of a start against Houston. An MRI at the time did not show any major damage, but Ventura missed his next scheduled start.
