LAS VEGAS -- The Dallas Mavericks have officially re-signed veteran guard Devin Harris, the team announced Thursday. The four-year deal is worth $16.55 million, with the fourth season partially guaranteed, sources told ESPN.com's Marc Stein. The guaranteed figure for the fourth year is $1.3 million.Â  Harris signed a one-year deal at the league minimum last season with the Mavs. He was slated to sign a three-year, $9 million deal with Dallas, but a toe problem that had plagued Harris for some time was deemed more severe than originally thought last summer. As a result, Dallas and Harris mutually agreed to shelve that contract. The surgery delayed Harris from making his season debut until mid-January of this past season. In his first season back with Dallas after starting his career there, Harris averaged 7.9 points and 4.5 assists in 40 games. But he shot a career-low 38 percent from the field, including just 31 percent from 3-point range. Harris will join Raymond Felton and Gal Mekel at the point guard position. With Harris re-signing, Dallas will have 13 of its15 roster spots taken. Sources have said that center Bernard James will take one of the available spots. He will be held out of the team's final summer league game on Friday. Dallas still has a $2.7 million cap-room exception at its disposal. The Mavs are still in the market for more bench perimeter shooting, potentially at the guard position. The likes of Mo Williams, Jameer Nelson, Jordan Crawford and Evan Turner could be targets.
