With Dwyane Wade missing numerous games as he manages knee issues, the Miami Heat have recently started trade talks looking for backcourt help, multiple league sources told ESPN. Wade missed his fifth game of the season Thursday night, this one due to illness, as the visiting Heat lost 107-87 to the Chicago Bulls. Coach Erik Spoelstra started Ray Allen in Wade's spot, the first start of Allen's tenure with Heat. Allen is the third player Spoelstra has tried in place of Wade this season. The Heat (14-5) have a glut of big men and have been looking into trading one for a guard, or to clear a roster spot so they can sign a player later. Center-forward Joel Anthony, who has played in just five games this season, is one of the players who may be available. Wade is still recovering from offseason procedures on his knees and is not currently playing in back-to-back games. Last month, after Wade did play in a back-to-back, knee soreness caused him to miss the next two games. Wade also missed Tuesday's game against the Detroit Pistons with knee soreness. The Heat have six back-to-backs scheduled over the next six weeks. The Heat, 2-3 without Wade this season, were 11-2 when he didn't play last season and 14-3 in 2011-12. Spoelstra has also tried James Jones and Roger Mason Jr. as starters when Wade has been out. Last season, the Heat routinely started Mike Miller when Wade needed days off to deal with knee or other issues. Miller was effective, averaging 10 points, five rebounds and three assists while shooting 49 percent in his 17 starts. The Heat released Miller over the summer using the amnesty provision, a move that is projected to save them about $17 million in luxury taxes this season. Miller is averaging 6.2 points and 3.5 assists as a reserve for the Memphis Grizzlies this season.
