NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets forwards Paul Pierce and Andrei Kirilenko had to come out of Sunday night's 104-89 victory against the Sacramento Kings due to injury. "They're both day to day, so we'll see how they feel tomorrow," Nets coach Jason Kidd said. Pierce was forced to leave the game due to a sore right shoulder, and the team later announced he would not return. Pierce re-injured his shoulder 1:13 into the first quarter while defending Kings forward Jason Thompson. He looked to be in agony as he headed into the locker room. Pierce has been dealing with what he called a "stinger" in his right shoulder, which forced him to come out briefly the last two games. "It's been a problem for me throughout the last few years," Pierce said Friday night. "It's weak right now, so whenever I get hit in that shoulder ... just with the constant years of banging, especially now that I'm playing the 4. So it's a quick stinger." Kirilenko said he sprained his right ankle in the first quarter when he stepped on point guard Deron Williams' foot. He tried to continue, but was forced to leave the game in the third quarter. "I don't think it's serious," Kirilenko said. "We'll see tomorrow. Usually the next day is a crucial day, so we'll see how it feels in the morning." The Nets face the Atlantic Division-leading Toronto Raptors on Monday night in a critical matchup. Brooklyn was also without center Kevin Garnett, who missed his fifth straight game due to back spasms.
