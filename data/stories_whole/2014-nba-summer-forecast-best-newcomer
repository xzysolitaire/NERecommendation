We'll roll out one by one, here and on Twitter theÂ ESPN Forecast team's picks for which player going to a new locale for the 2014-15 season will have the most positive impact. To participate in the discussion and perhaps get your opinion published on this page, #ESPNForecast is the Twitter hashtag to use. Or you can just follow along @ESPNNBA.
