Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins took to Twitter on Wednesday to walk back what appeared to be a shot at injured Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose. After missing Tuesday's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder because of a sprained right ankle, Cousins was asked if he would play Friday. "Probably not, think I'll be out rest of the season and I can get a comeback commercial," Cousins was quoted as saying by KXTV-ABC in Sacramento. It was an apparent reference to Rose, who underwent ACL surgery in May 2012 and was featured in a series of shoe commercials about his return to the court, only to sit out the 2012-13 season. On Wednesday afternoon, Cousins tweeted: Rose returned from the ACL injury this season but tore the meniscus in his other knee against the Portland Trail Blazers on Nov. 22. He was ruled out for the season following surgery Nov. 25.
