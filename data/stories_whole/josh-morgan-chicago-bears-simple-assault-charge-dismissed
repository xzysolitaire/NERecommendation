Chicago Bears wide receiver Josh Morgan agreed to a deal Tuesday in which a misdemeanor simple assault charge stemming from an April arrest would be dismissed upon completion of community service.  Morgan, 29, was arrested in April after allegedly punching a nightclub valet at a downtown Washington, D.C., nightclub. A judge told Morgan that if he completes the 32 hours of community service within four months, he will not have to return for his next court date Nov. 12. Morgan, who caught 20 passes for a career-low 214 yards last season with the Washington Redskins, signed a one-year deal with the Bears on April 21. He led the Redskins with 48 receptions for 510 yards in 2012. In Chicago, Morgan will face competition from Eric Weems and Chris Williams for roles on special teams and one of the reserve receiver spots if he doesn't beat out rising second-year man Marquess Wilson for the No. 3 position. Domenik Hixon also was expected to be in the competition at receiver, but he tore his ACL at organized team activities last month.
