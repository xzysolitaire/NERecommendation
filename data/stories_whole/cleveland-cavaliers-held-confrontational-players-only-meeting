After a recent losing streak, the Cleveland Cavaliers may also be dealing with some chemistry problems within the locker room. The Cavaliers held a players-only meeting following Wednesday's 29-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, multiple sources told ESPN.com. But the meeting got contentious, and players confronted each other, according to sources. The Cavs lost Friday, 86-80, to the Charlotte Bobcats after squandering a 12-point second-half lead, but snapped their three-game skid with a come-from-behind win over the Wizards in overtime Saturday night. Even with the win, Cleveland has lost five of its last seven games since starting the season 2-2. In a loss at the Chicago Bulls on Monday, Cavs coach Mike Brown and star guard Kyrie Irving got into an exchange on the bench after Brown pulled Irving from the game. The Cavaliers also have been making lineup changes recently, as several players' roles have been changing. Irving is struggling, shooting just 38 percent from the field and 32 percent from 3-point range. He was just 5-of-16 shooting in the loss to the Bobcats, but scored a game-high 41 in Saturday's win. Irving, who is averaging a team-leading 19.3 points and 7.2 assists, took to Twitter after Friday's loss. Cleveland center Andrew Bynum who returned to the lineup after missing two games because of personal family reasons, getting the start Saturday and finishing with six points and three rebounds.
