The Denver Nuggets have acquired guard Arron Afflalo from the Orlando Magic for guard Evan Fournier and the 56th pick in Thursday night's NBA draft, sources told ESPN.com. It is a return to Denver for Afflalo, who played with the Nuggets from 2009 to 2012 before being traded to the Magic as part of the Dwight Howard trade. He is coming off a career season in which he averaged 18.2 points. The Magic seemed eager to move their top returning scorer because he has the option to become a free agent after next season, in which he will earn $7.5 million. He was mentioned often in numerous trade talks in recent days. The Nuggets acquired Afflalo using a trade exception. In return, the Magic get the developing Fournier, a native of France who is just 21 years old heading into his third season. The former first-round pick averaged 8.3 points and 2.7 rebounds last season for the Nuggets.  The Magic selected Arizona forward Aaron Gordon with the No. 4 pick and later traded forward Dario Saric, along with future first- and second-round picks, to the Philadelphia 76ers for guard Elfrid Payton. Denver selected Creighton standout Doug McDermott at No. 11, before sending him and veteran Anthony Randolph to Chicago for center Jusuf Nurkic (No. 16), guard Gary Harris (No. 19) and a future second-round pick in a trade that is still pending.
