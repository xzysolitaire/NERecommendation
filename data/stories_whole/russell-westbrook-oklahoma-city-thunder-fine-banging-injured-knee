OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook is fine after leaving Friday's game against Toronto in the third quarter with what appeared to be an injury to his surgically repaired right knee. A Thunder spokesman said the three-time All-Star had an MRI and a clinical exam Saturday, and team doctors said there were no issues after Toronto's Kyle Lowry inadvertently jumped into Westbrook near the sideline with 7:37 left in the third quarter Friday night. Westbrook has been playing restricted minutes since his return in February from his most recent surgery. After the contact with Lowry, Westbrook immediately turned and called timeout and bent over in pain. He hobbled along the sideline and was tended to briefly by a trainer before walking off the court with help from center Hasheem Thabeet. "I'm pain-free," Westbrook said Friday night, according to The Oklahoman. "I'm just going to ... get it looked at and go from there." Westbrook, who has played in 37 games this season, is expected to miss one of Oklahoma City's next two games as they will be played on consecutive days. The Thunder host the Denver Nuggets on Monday and visit the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.
