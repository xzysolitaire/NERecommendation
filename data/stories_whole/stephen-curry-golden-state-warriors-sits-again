LOS ANGELES -- Stephen Curry is missing his second straight game for the Golden State Warriors due to a concussion. The Warriors declared Curry out for Friday night's visit to the Los Angeles Lakers about an hour before tipoff. Curry got hurt in the fourth quarter of Golden State's win at Utah on Monday night when he hit his head on the court while scrambling for a loose ball. The fifth-year pro can't be cleared to return to uniform until he participates in contact drills and shows no symptoms, according to the NBA's concussion protocol. He also missed Wednesday's game against Memphis. Curry is averaging 19.9 points and 8.7 assists in 10 games this season, ranking fourth in the NBA in assists. Harrison Barnes is expected to start for the Warriors.
