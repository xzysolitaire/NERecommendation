The Toronto Raptors are in the hunt to acquire the Memphis Grizzlies' No. 22 overall pick in Thursday night's draft, according to sources familiar with the deal. But the Raptors, sources said, would have to take back Tayshaun Prince via trade to make the deal happen. Sources told ESPN.com that the Raptors and Grizzlies have discussed a trade in which Toronto sends John Salmons and the No. 37 overall pick to Memphis for Prince and the Grizzlies' No. 22 pick in the first round. The move appeals to Toronto, sources say, because it would give the Raptors two picks in the presumed range needed to draft Canadian guard Tyler Ennis from Syracuse. The Raptors already possess the No. 20 pick and, according to sources, covet both Ennis and Swiss power forward Clint Capela, who some scouts liken to Serge Ibaka and is said to have caught the eye of Toronto general manager Masai Ujiri. For the Grizzlies, sources say, shedding Prince's contract -- he's owed $7.7 million next season -- is a draft-night priority. But the likelihood is that it'll cost Memphis its No. 22 pick to do so.
