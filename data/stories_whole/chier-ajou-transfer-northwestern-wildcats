EVANSTON, Ill. -- Chier Ajou, a second-year center on the Northwestern men's basketball team, is transferring, coach Chris Collins said Tuesday. A native of South Sudan, Ajou is a cousin of Luol Deng, who was traded from the Chicago Bulls to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Ajou appeared in seven games as a true freshman in 2012-13 prior to undergoing season-ending knee surgery. He received a medical hardship waiver and played in one game this season, against UCLA on Nov. 29. In 2012, Northwestern said the NCAA had cleared Ajou to play after there were reportedly some questions about his high school transcript. He played two years for Culver (Ind.) Academies before attending St. Thomas More School in Connecticut.
