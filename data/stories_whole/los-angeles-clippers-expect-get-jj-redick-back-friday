LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick is expected to return to the lineup Friday for the first time since suffering a fracture in the small bone of his right hand and a tear of his right ulnar collateral ligament Nov. 29. Redick suffered the injury during the Clippers' game against the Sacramento Kings and originally was expected to miss six to eight weeks. "I think J.J. has a very good chance of playing Friday," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "If he's ready we'll probably start him." The Clippers also will bring Hedo Turkoglu in for a meeting and a workout on Thursday. Turkoglu, who was cut by the Orlando Magic on Friday and cleared waivers, hasn't played this season. The veteran guard played in only 11 games last season because of injuries and a 20-game suspension for use of performance-enhancing drugs. If the Clippers sign Turkoglu, they would waive Darius Morris or Maalik Wayns, two point guards they signed to 10-day contracts this week with Chris Paul sidelined six weeks with a separated right shoulder. "We're looking at him," Rivers said of Turkoglu. "We're going to bring him in and work him out pretty soon." Clippers forward Reggie Bullock, who has been out since Dec. 7 with a sprained left ankle, may play Friday, but Rivers said it's more likely he'll return next week.
