ATLANTA -- The NBA is planning to review a scuffle from the first half of Game 6 of the Pacers' 95-88 win against the Hawks, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Atlanta's Mike Scott and Indiana guard George Hill got into it under the basket after a missed shot late in the second quarter Thursday night, shoving each other in front of the Pacers bench. Replays showed Pacers star Paul George and a teammate taking a step onto the court, though they were quickly pushed back by the assistant coaches. Players are subject to suspension for leaving their bench during on-court altercations. No punched were thrown. Scott and Hill were each assessed a technical foul. After Indiana's victory tied the series at three games apiece, Indiana coach Frank Vogel said he's "not concerned about any suspensions until we hear something." He added, "I don't imagine there would be." Game 7 is Saturday in Indiana.
