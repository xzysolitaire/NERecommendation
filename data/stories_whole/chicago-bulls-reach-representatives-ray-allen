The Chicago Bulls have touched base with the representatives of veteran shooting guard Ray Allen, a league source confirmed Monday. The Bulls are one of several teams interested in Allen. The Bulls have had an active offseason, adding free agents Pau Gasol and Aaron Brooks, rookie Doug McDermott and European star Nikola Mirotic. On paper, they have one of the deepest teams in the league and fully expect to contend for a championship behind Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah -- a fact they'll surely sell to Allen's reps. Another key selling point for the Bulls is Allen's relationship with coach Tom Thibodeau. Allen won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 while Thibodeau was an assistant on Doc Rivers' staff. Allen would give the Bulls another long-range shooter to go along with McDermott and veteran Mike Dunleavy. News of the Bulls' interest was earlier reported on the team's website.
