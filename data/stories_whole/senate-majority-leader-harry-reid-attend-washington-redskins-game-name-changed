WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he won't attend a Washington Redskins home game until the football team changes its name. In a letter Monday to the team's president, Reid called the Redskins name a racial slur that disparages the American people. The Nevada Democrat, who said he represents 27 tribes in his state, rejected Bruce Allen's invitation to a Redskins home game until the team does the right thing and changes its name. In May, half of the Senate wrote letters to the NFL urging a change in the team's name. Redskins owner Dan Snyder has vowed never to change the name. Allen had written to Reid saying the football team's nickname is "respectful" toward Native Americans.
