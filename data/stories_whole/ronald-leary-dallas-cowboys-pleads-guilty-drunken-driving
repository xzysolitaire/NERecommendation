DALLAS -- A Cowboys offensive lineman has pleaded guilty to a first-time drunken driving charge. Ronald Leary was arrested in suburban Dallas in September 2012 after failing a field sobriety test. According to the arrest warrant affidavit, he was pulled over for multiple traffic violations and on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Online court records show the Cowboys' starting left guard pleaded guilty Thursday. He will receive 18 months of probation and a $1,000 fine. A message seeking comment was left with his attorney Monday. Leary was a Memphis University guard before the Cowboys signed him as a free agent in 2012. He has had a chronic knee problem.
