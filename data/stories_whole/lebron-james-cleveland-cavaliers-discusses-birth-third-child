The King finally talked about his new princess. LeBron James and his wife, Savannah, welcomed their third child, and first daughter, Zhuri Nova James, the Cleveland Cavaliers confirmed. She was born last Wednesday in Akron, Ohio, according to multiple reports. "It's great. We have a great family, man, and my family is happy," James said of his new baby daughter. "It's a blessing to be able to add another one to our family, and I'm going to try to keep it going." James married his high school sweetheart in September 2013. The couple have two sons, LeBron Jr., 10, and Bryce Maximus, 7. "It's different. It's a lot different," James said of being a father to a girl. "For me, you give rough love to your boys and you give soft love to your daughter. I understand that, and I'm looking forward to the journey of all three of them growing up." James and the Cavs open the 2014-15 NBA season Thursday at home against the New York Knicks.
