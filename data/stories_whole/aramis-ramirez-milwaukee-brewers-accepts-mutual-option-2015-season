MILWAUKEE -- Aramis Ramirez has accepted his half of the $14 million mutual option in his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Milwaukee exercised its half of the option Friday, and the Brewers announced Ramirez's decision Monday. If the option had been declined, he would have become a free agent. The 36-year-old third baseman is heading into his 18th major league season. He earned $32 million over the first three seasons of the contract and would have received a $4 million buyout had the Brewers declined their half of the option. Ramirez hit .285 with 15 home runs and 66 RBIs in 133 games last season, his third with the Brewers and 17th overall. The right-handed third baseman has spent his entire career in the National League Central, previously playing with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and Brewers. Ramirez, a three-time All-Star and career .285 hitter, has 2,186 hits (including 369 home runs) in his career.
