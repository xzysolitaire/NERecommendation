MILWAUKEE -- Michael Redd, a former All-Star guard who became the fourth-leading scorer in Bucks history in a career hampered by injuries, will retire in Milwaukee on Wednesday. The team announced Redd's decision Tuesday and said he will make a formal announcement when Milwaukee hosts Cleveland. Redd was a second-round pick out of Ohio State in 2000, 43rd overall, and he played 11 of his 12 seasons with Milwaukee. Two separate injuries to his left knee cost him large chunks of three straight seasons with the Bucks, and he last played for Phoenix in 2011-12. He finishes his NBA career with 11,972 points (11,554 with Milwaukee) and as a 44.7 percent shooter, 38.0 from 3-point range. For Milwaukee, he averaged 20.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. Redd, a reserve on the 2003 All-Star team, reached the playoffs three times with the Bucks. He was also on the gold medal-winning U.S. team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Redd tore ligaments in his left knee in January 2009, then did it again in January 2010. On Nov. 11, 2006, Redd set the franchise's individual game scoring record with 57 against Utah, breaking the mark set in 1971 by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (55). Redd also holds the NBA record for 3-pointers made in one quarter (eight in the fourth quarter against Houston on Feb. 20, 2002). "It's been a glorious 11 years," Redd said as he wrapped up his career with the Bucks in April 2011. "I wouldn't trade anything. Just had a tremendous journey over these 11 years. They've seen me grow up, because I've been here since I was 20 years old. It's been an amazing journey. Some ups, some downs. But through it all, the fans have been great, the organization's been great to my family."
