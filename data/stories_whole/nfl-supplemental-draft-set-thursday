NFL general managers will have a brief break from their vacations Thursday when they can participate in the supplemental draft. The four-player draft will be held at 1 p.m., but there is no guarantee any of the players will be drafted. If they aren't, they become undrafted free agents and can sign with any team. New Mexico wide receiver-running back Chase Clayton, North Carolina linebacker Darius Lipford, Virginia University of Lynchburg defensive tackle Lakendrick Ross and SMU running back Traylon Shead are the four players available. The 6-foot-5, 360-pound Ross has drawn a lot of interest. He's raw, but he's strong. He benched 47 reps at 225 pounds. He recently sent out an Instagram video in which he dunks a basketball. Clayton is a fast returner who had a 30.4 kickoff-return average in 2012 and scored two touchdowns. Shead is a 240-pound back who rushed for 197 yards and scored three touchdowns last season. Lipford recovered from a 2012 knee injury and played for North Carolina last year. Last year, six players were eligible for the supplemental draft, but no one was selected. The last supplemental draft selection was Josh GordonÂ by the Cleveland Browns in 2012. The players are available through seven rounds. If a player is selected, the team that chooses him would give up a 2015 draft choice in the round of its supplemental draft selection.
