PORTLAND, Ore. -- Golden State center Andrew Bogut underwent rib X-rays following the Warriors' 119-117 overtime loss at Portland on Sunday night. Bogut did not play in overtime, but finished with two points and nine rebounds in nearly 32 minutes. The eight-year NBA veteran is averaging 7.4 points, 10 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 66 games for Golden State this season. Results of the X-ray were not immediately available. Warriors coach Mark Jackson was taking a wait-and-see approach, telling reporters after the game that he'd wait to see how the situation plays out. The apparent injury comes four games into Bogut's return from a pelvis contusion that sidelined him for four games.
