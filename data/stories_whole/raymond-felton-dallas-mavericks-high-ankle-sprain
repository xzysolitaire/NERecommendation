DALLAS -- Mavericks guard Raymond Felton will miss an extended period of time due to a high right ankle sprain, coach Rick Carlisle told reporters. Felton suffered the injury when he landed on the foot of Oklahoma City Thunder swingman Anthony Morrow on a drive to the basket during the first quarter of Friday's preseason loss. He did not return to the game and left the American Airlines Center that night on crutches with a protective boot on his right foot. Carlisle said the team would provide an update on Felton's condition in 10 days. The recovery time for high ankle sprains can be up to six weeks, depending on the severity. Felton, who was acquired in a June trade with the New York Knicks, will serve a suspension in the first four games of the season stemming from his guilty plea on gun charges during last season. The Mavs plan for Felton to be a key reserve in a guard rotation that will also include Jameer Nelson, Monta Ellis and Devin Harris. Felton must be healthy and available to play to begin serving his suspension, an NBA spokesman confirmed. Carlisle expressed confidence that Felton would be healthy at the beginning of the regular season, meaning he would only have to sit out four games. Ellis will sit out his second consecutive preseason game Sunday against the Indiana Pacers due to a sprained left knee suffered during Thursday's practice. The Mavs do not consider Ellis' injury to be serious. Mavs power forward Dirk Nowitzki will make his preseason debut Sunday night after missing the first two games because of a right hip contusion.
