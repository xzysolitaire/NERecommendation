Brooklyn Nets reserve center Andray Blatche was fined $15,000 by the league for making an obscene gesture late in the team's 101-100 victory over the Miami Heat Friday night at Barclays Center, NBA president of basketball operations Rod Thorn announced Saturday. Blatche celebrated Joe Johnson's 3-pointer by making a gesture of a sexual nature on the sideline with 2:40 remaining in the fourth quarter. Blatche, 27, had nine points and six rebounds in 25 minutes in helping the Nets rebound from a season-opening loss to Cleveland.
