WASHINGTON -- Lady Gaga was no match for the NBA's playoff schedule. The Washington Wizards announced Tuesday that the Grammy winner's May 15 concert at the Verizon Center has been moved up to May 12 because it conflicts with a possible Game 6 in the club's Eastern Conference playoff series against the Indiana Pacers. The conflict has caused much consternation among Gaga fans who had planned months ahead to travel to Washington on a specific date, but the NBA's television commitments held sway. Wizards and Verizon Center owner Ted Leonsis blogged his "sincere apology" for inconveniencing the singer's fans.
