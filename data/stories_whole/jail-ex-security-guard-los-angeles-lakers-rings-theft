LOS ANGELES -- A former security guard who stole Los Angeles Lakers championship rings from a training center has been sentenced to 180 days in jail. Los Angeles County prosecutors say Mejia Monterroso pleaded no contest to grand theft Friday. He also will have to pay nearly $14,000 in restitution. Monterroso was arrested in December. Prosecutors say the 23-year-old was a guard at the Toyota Sports Center in El Segundo last year when he took three championship rings and hundreds of gift cards during a night shift. Police say they found two of the rings at his Inglewood home.
