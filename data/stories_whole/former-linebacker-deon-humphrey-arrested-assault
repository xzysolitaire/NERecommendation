WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Former Florida State and NFL linebacker Deon Humphrey has been arrested in an assault on his girlfriend. The 38-year-old was taken into custody early Thursday and charged with domestic battery by strangulation. The Palm Beach Sheriff's Office says deputies who arrived at the linebacker's Wellington home found redness on his girlfriend's neck and bleeding from her ear consistent with being grabbed by the neck. A probable cause affidavit says the woman reported being shoved against a wall. Deputies say they found indentations in the wall and her black hairs in the plaster. Humphrey is free on $5,000 bond. His public defender said she couldn't comment. In three seasons in the NFL, Humphrey played for the Carolina Panthers, San Diego Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars.
