Legislation introduced last week in New York state to allow earlier beer sales at Buffalo Bills games will not make it to a vote. The Buffalo News reported Tuesday that the bill has not moved in the state's assembly and will not reach a vote before the legislative session ends Thursday. "It's dead," Assemblyman Sean RyanÂ told the newspaper. The Bills had approached local lawmakers to push for a bill that would permit beer sales beginning at 11 a.m. for Sunday games with a 1 p.m. kickoff. The objective of the measure was to bring more fans inside the stadium to consume alcohol in a "controlled" environment. Most teams open their stadiums 90 minutes prior to kickoff and start beer sales at that point. Under current law, the Bills cannot sell beer until noon for 1 p.m. games. All eight of the team's home games this season will kick off at 1 p.m. A similar bill was proposed two years ago but failed, according to the newspaper. That proposal was resisted by some businesses around the Bills' stadium.
