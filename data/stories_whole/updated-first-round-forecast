Thursday night features three pivotal Game 3s in series knotted at 1-1, so we asked our ESPN Forecast panel to update their series predictions, given what we know now about each team. While the Hawks, Grizzlies and Warriors have been impressive in pulling out road wins, the panel still sees the Pacers, Thunder and Clippers ultimately advancing to the next round. But according to our panel, it will take an extra game (or two for Indy) for the higher seeds to prevail. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games, and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
