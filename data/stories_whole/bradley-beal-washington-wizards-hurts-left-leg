The Minnesota Timberwolves handed the Washington Wizards their worst loss of the season, a 120-98 defeat Friday night, but the Wizards hope they didn't lose something much more important than just one game. Guard Bradley Beal had to be helped off the floor in the fourth quarter with a left leg injury. Preliminary X-rays were negative on his left knee, and he will have an MRI on Saturday. Beal scored 14 points in 26 minutes but got tangled up on a screen by Wolves forward Luc Mbah a Moute with 4:25 to go. Beal was knocked to the ground and couldn't put any pressure on his left leg as Jan Vesely and Trevor Ariza helped him to the locker room. "I was just trying to really get up and I really couldn't get up," Beal said. "Was hoping it wasn't anything too serious or too crazy. I mean, I was able to put a little weight on it afterwards. Just have to see with the MRI tomorrow." Beal missed nine games this season with a stress fracture in his right leg, and the Wizards count on his scoring as part of their dynamic young backcourt. "With the knee injuries going on this year in the NBA, you just hope [Beal's] isn't one of those ones that [is] devastating," John Wall said. Wizards forward Kevin Seraphin also missed the game with a sore right knee.
