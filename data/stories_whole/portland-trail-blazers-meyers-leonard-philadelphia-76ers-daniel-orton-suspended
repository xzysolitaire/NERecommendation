NEW YORK -- Portland center Meyers Leonard and Philadelphia center Daniel Orton were each suspended for one game without pay by the NBA on Sunday for their altercation Saturday night. Leonard initiated an altercation by slamming Orton to the floor, and Orton retaliated by elbowing Leonard in the mouth in the fourth quarter of Portland's 139-105 victory in Philadelphia. Leonard sat out Portland's game at Detroit on Sunday, and Orton will miss Philadelphia's game at Brooklyn on Monday night.
