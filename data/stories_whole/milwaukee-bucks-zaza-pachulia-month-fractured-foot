MILWAUKEE -- The hits keep coming to the Bucks' roster. General manager John Hammond said Monday that center Zaza Pachulia will be sidelined with a right foot fracture suffered in last week's 105-98 loss to the Detroit Pistons. The 6-foot-11 center missed the next two games. Pachulia will have to wear a walking boot until being re-examined in four weeks. He had been a solid contributor on a team beset by injuries, averaging 6.9 points and 6.5 rebounds in 17 games. Milwaukee is already without two starters in center Larry Sanders (thumb) and forward Caron Butler (knee). Point guard Brandon Knight has also missed time this season with a hamstring injury. The Bucks (4-16) had the worst record in the Eastern Conference headed into Tuesday night's game at Chicago.
