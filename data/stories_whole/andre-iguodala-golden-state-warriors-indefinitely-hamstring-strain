Golden State Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala is out indefinitely with a strained left hamstring, the team announced Saturday. Iguodala, who suffered the injury Friday against the Los Angeles Lakers, did not play in Saturday's 113-101 home loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Iguodala admitted he was worried "a little bit" after sustaining the injury in the third quarter of Friday's 102-95 loss. "We'll take it serious," he told ESPN.com. "I'm sure I'll be back really soon. My body has been pretty good to me so far. It'll be sooner than everyone thinks." Iguodala grabbed his left hamstring as he was running down the court in the late stages of the third quarter. During a stop in play, Iguodala grimaced as he talked to Warriors coach Mark Jackson, who substituted Kent Bazemore into the game. Iguodala limped to the locker room. "I knew it was something," Iguodala said. "Normally I can just run it off, or it will go away. But once I heard it pop, I knew it was serious." The Warriors have a host of other injuries to deal with.Â Backup point guard Toney Douglas has an injured tibia, Jermaine O'Neal has a bruised right knee and strained groin, and Ognjen Kuzmic has a broken right hand. Festus Ezeli has yet to play this season while recovering from right knee surgery.
