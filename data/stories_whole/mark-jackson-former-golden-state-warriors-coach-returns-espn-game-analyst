Former Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson has reached a multiyear agreement to return to ESPN as an NBA game analyst. Jackson will work Sunday during ESPN's telecast of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers. Jackson will join play-by-play commentator Mike Breen and fellow analyst Jeff Van Gundy, reuniting the trio that broadcast the NBA Finals for five consecutive years. A former All-Star point guard during his 17-year career as a player, Jackson was fired by the Warriors earlier this month following the team's first-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.Â The Warriors have hired Steve Kerr, another analyst without coaching experience. The Warriors went 51-31 this season under Jackson, posting their best record since 1991-92. Jackson went 121-109 in three seasons with Golden State, which reached the postseason each of the last two years. He had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the New York Knicks' vacant head coaching position.
