METAIRIE, La. -- The Pelicans say All-Star forward Anthony Davis will miss New Orleans' final four regular-season games. The club also says guard Eric Gordon is scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee next week. Davis, who has averaged 20.8 points, 10.0 rebounds and 2.8 blocks this season, sat out Wednesday night's loss to Phoenix with back soreness. The club says team doctors have determined that Davis could use another week or two of rest to heal properly. Gordon, who has averaged 15.4 points in 64 games, has missed 10 straight contests with left knee tendinitis. The Pelicans say he's expected to make a full recovery during the offseason. New Orleans' season concludes with two games each against Oklahoma City and Houston, starting Friday night in Oklahoma City.
