PHOENIX -- Phoenix Suns center Alex Len has re-fractured his right pinkie finger. Len initially fractured the finger in the Suns' first Summer League game in Las Vegas. The team said in a brief statement that Len was sidelined and would be re-evaluated on Oct. 18. The 7-foot-1 Len, the fifth overall pick in the 2013 draft, got off to a slow start to his NBA career after undergoing ankle surgery before his rookie season.
