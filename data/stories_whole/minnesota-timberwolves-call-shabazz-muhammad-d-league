MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have recalled rookie Shabazz Muhammad from their NBA Development League affiliate. The move was made on Monday. Muhammad played in four games for the Iowa Energy, averaging 24.5 points on 57.1 percent shooting and 9.8 rebounds. The 14th overall pick in last year's draft, Muhammad has barely played at all for the Timberwolves, scoring 12 points in 11 games and a total of just 42 minutes. The swingman from UCLA averaged 17.9 points and 5.2 rebounds for the Pac-12 regular-season champion Bruins in 2012-13. Muhammad was initially resistant to playing in the D-League, but the Wolves insisted the stint was best for his development.
