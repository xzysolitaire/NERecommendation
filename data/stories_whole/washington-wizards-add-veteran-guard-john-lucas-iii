The Washington Wizards, looking for a trusted veteran to add to their guard depth, added John Lucas III on Tuesday. The Wizards looked to add the 31-year-old Lucas after losing star guard Bradley Beal to a wrist injury that's expected to sideline him for at least six weeks.‎ Lucas was born in Washington, D.C., and spent last season with the Utah Jazz, his fourth NBA team after stints with Houston, Chicago and Toronto. Possessing an unguaranteed contract for this season with the Jazz, Lucas found himself at the heart of two trades this summer, ‎first moving from Utah to Cleveland as part of a multiplayer swap in July and then going from Cleveland to Boston in a Sept. 25 deal just before the Cavaliers opened training camp. With no need for another point guard, Boston agreed to waive him a few days after trading for him to allow ‎Lucas to find a new team.
