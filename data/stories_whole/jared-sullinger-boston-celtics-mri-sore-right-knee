WALTHAM, Mass. -- Boston Celtics forwardÂ Jared Sullinger underwent a precautionary MRI on his right knee at New England Baptist Hospital on Tuesday and the results revealed a bone bruise, according to the team. Sullinger is listed as day to day. Orlando's Maurice Harkless slammed hard into Sullinger's right knee, forcing Boston's second-year forward to crash backwards late in the first half of Boston's 120-105 triumph. Sullinger did play 14 minutes, 33 seconds in the second half. He sat out practice Tuesday and departed with trainer Ed Lacerte near the end of the session. "He's got a sore knee and they are doing an MRI just to check out and see what's wrong," said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. "Nothing conclusive, and certainly day to day it sounds like they are looking at, but we just don't know yet, so we want to make sure." Sullinger is averaging 11.3 points and 5.1 rebounds over 19.7 minutes per game in seven appearances (he was suspended for the team's season opener). Sullinger tops the team in plus-minus at plus-30. If Sullinger is unable to go, it would likely mean an elevated role for veteran Kris Humphries, who has played well (second best on the team at plus-27 overall) in small bursts while waiting for an extended opportunity.
