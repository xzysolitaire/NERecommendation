Dallas Mavericks guard Devin Harris is active for tonight's game against the Utah Jazz, per team officials. Harris left Tuesday night's 108-85 loss to the Golden State Warriors in the second quarter due to a sore right Achilles tendon. The injury came at a troubling time for Harris and the Mavericks as the versatile guard was starting to gain momentum. Before the injury, Harris was coming off of his two best performances of the season as he averaged 16.0 points on 66.7 percent shooting in wins over the Portland Trail Blazers and Indiana Pacers. In addition to the efficiency on offense, Harris had earned the trust of coach Rick Carlisle and began closing out games alongside fellow guard Monta Ellis. Harris told reporters after the game in Oakland that he started feeling soreness in the Achilles during last week's loss to the Denver Nuggets, but the injury wasn't serious enough for him to miss time. Harris has played in only 23 games this season due to rehabilitating from toe surgery that occurred during the summer. He said that he felt soreness once again prior to the game against the Warriors and left after playing less than seven minutes of game action. In further injury update news, second year swingman Jae Crowder did not join the team in Utah as he stayed in Dallas as he is still recovering from a mild abdominal strain. Carlisle hasn't ruled out Crowder rejoining the team for their next game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.
