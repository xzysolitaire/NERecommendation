OAKLAND, Calif. -- Milwaukee Bucks center Larry Sanders will not return this season because of a fractured right orbital bone. Bucks coach Larry Drew confirmed Sanders has been ruled out for the remainder of the season before his team faced the Golden State Warriors in Oakland on Thursday night. Sanders was injured Feb. 8 when Houston's James Harden elbowed him in the right eye as the two went for a rebound. He had surgery shortly afterward. Sanders also missed nearly two months earlier this season after tearing a ligament in his right thumb during a fight at a Milwaukee night club. He averaged 7.7 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 23 games this season after signing a four-year extension worth about $44 million.
