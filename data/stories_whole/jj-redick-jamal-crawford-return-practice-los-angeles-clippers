PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Clippers took their team picture before Thursday's practice, and for the first time, every player in the team photo was able to practice together. Clippers guard J.J. Redick, who has missed the past 18 games with a bulging disk in his lower back, returned to practice for the first time in seven weeks. He is hopeful to return soon but likely will not play in Saturday's game against the Detroit Pistons. Redick also missed 21 games earlier this season with a fractured right wrist. "I don't have an expectation," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of Redick. "I think he just wants to go back out and practice and see how he feels. We're just going to practice him and see what he could do." There was a feeling that the Clippers wanted to determine by the end of the month whether Redick could return this season in order to make plans to move forward with or without him. Rivers, however, said that was not the case and the team would wait for whenever he was healthy enough to play. "If J.J. comes back tomorrow, we're good," Rivers said. "If J.J. comes back in three weeks, we're good. If J.J. comes back in eight weeks and we're still alive, we're good. I don't think there is a timetable." Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, who has missed eight of the last nine games with a strained left calf, returned to practice as well and is hoping to be back in the lineup Saturday. "He's going to practice, and if he feels good, he's going to play," Rivers said of Crawford. "We have two days of practice so we'll have a pretty good feeling. I want him to play but I don't want to push him. I want him to be right. If he's ready to play, he'll play, and if not we'll wait until we play again. He's close enough that he'll be playing soon." Clippers guard Darren Collison, who has missed the last two games with a stomach virus, felt fine and will likely start on Saturday. "He's OK," Rivers said of Collison. "He's good."
