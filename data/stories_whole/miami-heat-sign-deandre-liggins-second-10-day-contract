The Miami Heat have signed forward DeAndre Liggins to a second 10-day contract, the team announced Saturday. Liggins played just one minute of one game over his first 10 days with the team. The Heat brought him in for depth in case of injury and for nights when Dwyane Wade may rest. Liggins was a D-League All-Star this season, appearing in 35 games with Sioux Falls and averaging 14.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.5 steals for the Skyforce. Miami's roster remains at 15 players with the Liggins move. Miami plays at the Chicago Bulls on Sunday (1 p.m. ET, ABC).
