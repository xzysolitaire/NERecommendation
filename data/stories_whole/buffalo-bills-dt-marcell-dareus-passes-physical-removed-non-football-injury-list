PITTSFORD, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Marcell Dareus passed his physical and was removed from the non-football injury list Thursday, a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Field Yates. The move means that Dareus has passed the team's conditioning test, which he failed upon reporting to training camp last week. Dareus likely will rejoin the Bills at their next practice Friday evening. Bills defensive tackle Alan Branch also passed his physical, a league source told Yates. Branch has failed his conditioning test and was on the non-football illness list.
