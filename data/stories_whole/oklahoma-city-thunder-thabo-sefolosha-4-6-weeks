OKLAHOMA CITY -- Thunder guard Thabo Sefolosha will miss four to six weeks with a left calf strain. Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti made the announcement Sunday before the team's game against Charlotte. Sefolosha left Friday's game against Memphis in the first half and didn't return. The 6-foot-7 defensive stopper from Switzerland had started 55 of the team's 59 games this season and averaged 6.7 points and 3.7 rebounds. Perry Jones, a 6-foot-11 forward, will fill the starting slot. Sefolosha is the second starter the Thunder have lost since the All-Star break. Center Kendrick Perkins was injured Feb. 20 against Miami, and the veteran enforcer is expected to miss another five weeks with a left groin strain.
