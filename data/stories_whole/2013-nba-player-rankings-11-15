ESPN.com and the TrueHoop Network are ranking every NBA player for the third straight year -- and counting them down on Twitter (@ESPNNBA), from No. 500 to No. 1. This year, we asked our ESPN Forecast panel to the overall level of play for each player for the upcoming NBA season. This includes both the quality and the quantity of his expected contributions, combined in one overall rating. As the rankings are announced, you can also find them here on the pages of ESPN.com. We are starting by running through the "first" 100 players on Sept. 16, and thereafter we will count them down one at a time on Twitter, until Oct. 29, opening night in the NBA. #NBArank is the Twitter hashtag to use if you want to get involved in the discussion or just follow along.
