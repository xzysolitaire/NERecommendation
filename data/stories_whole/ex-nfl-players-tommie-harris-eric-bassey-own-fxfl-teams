AUSTIN, Texas -- Former NFL players Tommie Harris and Eric Bassey are the first owners of a team in the new FXFL developmental league. The Fall Experimental Football League, which has no affiliation with the NFL, plans to play six games in October and November in six U.S. cities. Harris and Bassey will own the Austin franchise, with other teams to be located in the New York and Boston areas; Omaha, Nebraska; Portland, Oregon; and a city in Florida yet to be determined. Harris played eight seasons in the NFL, seven with Bears, where he was a three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle. Bassey spent two seasons with the Rams as a defensive back. Bassey says Austin is the right spot for a developmental team in Texas.
