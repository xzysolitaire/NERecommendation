CLEVELAND -- A fan walked onto the court during the second quarter of the Cleveland Cavaliers' 88-82 win against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, tapped Kyrie Irving on the shoulder and continued to follow him down the court before finally being taken away. With 3:09 left in the second quarter, a fan wearing jeans and a black jacket walked onto the court behind Irving after the point guard had passed the ball to Andrew Bynum and stood on top of the key. After Bynum missed a shot in the paint, the fan tapped Irving on the shoulder, unzipped his jacket and tried to show him a white shirt that read, "KYRIE DONT LEAVE" in all caps, written in black marker. The fan then began to walk down the court in Irving's direction as Chris Paul was dribbling the ball before the game was finally stopped at the 3:02 mark. Referee Gary Zielinski grabbed the fan before security ran onto the court and physically removed him as he tried to get away. The Cavaliers confirmed the fan, who is a minor, was in custody and removed from the arena. Last season, when the Cavaliers were playing the Miami Heat, a fan ran onto the court during the fourth quarter with a shirt that read "We Miss You" on the front and "LeBron 2014" on the back.
