SAN FRANCISCO -- Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul participated in shootaround Thursday and will start Game 3 against the Golden State Warriors despite dealing with an injured right hamstring. "It's all right," Paul said. "I didn't do a whole lot but I'll be ready for tonight." When asked if he anticipated playing the whole game Paul said, "I hope so. As long as [coach] Doc [Rivers] will let me." Rivers has restricted Paul, who injured his hamstring in Game 1, and Clippers guard Jamal Crawford over the past two days. Crawford re-injured his left calf in the first half of Game 2 but will play Thursday. "Jamal is OK but he didn't do a lot," Rivers said. "We knew this coming in. He played two games on it and it's sore so we're just going to see." Crawford was sidelined for five games with a strained left calf at the end of the season. It was the same injury that sidelined him for eight of nine games last month. "I got lots and lots of treatment," Crawford said. "The calf limits you a lot. It happened in the first half of the last game and I pulled myself out. I just felt it and I knew. It's discouraging but you just got to get through it. It's the playoffs. I'll be OK. No question. I'm playing."
