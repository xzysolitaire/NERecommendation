The Baltimore Orioles declined their $17.5 million mutual option on Nick Markakis' contract, perhaps ending the veteran outfielder's nine-year stint in Baltimore. Markakis will receive a $2 million buyout as part of the six-year, $66.1 million deal he signed with the Orioles in 2009. The Orioles announced their decision Friday, four days before Markakis can become a free agent. Baltimore also declined its $5 million option on catcher Nick Hundley. Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette told the Baltimore Sun that he hopes to keep Markakis in Baltimore. "Nick is a dependable [player], and the O's would like to continue [their] relationship with him," Duquette told the Sun. Markakis, 30, batted .276 with 14 home runs and 50 RBIs, helping the Orioles win the AL East for the first time since 1997 and reach the postseason for the second time in the last three years. Baltimore's first-round draft pick in 2003, Markakis has spent his entire career with the Orioles, batting .290 with 141 homers. Markakis, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, has at least 10 home runs and 24 doubles in each season of his career. He committed zero errors in 149 games in the field last season -- 147 in right field. In his entire nine-year career, Markakis has been credited with just 18 errors.
