Denver Nuggets point guard Nate Robinson, who is out for the season after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee in January, vows that he'll exercise his player option and return to the team next season. "Things happen," Robinson told the Denver Post on Wednesday. "God always has a plan for everybody. So, it's just another obstacle that I've got to hop over and keep pushing. But for me, it's going push me to continue to work hard. "You can't take your game for granted. It just shows your character. It shows how hard and how bad you really want it. I'm a player that, I love this game. I'm going to come back strong and ready to play." Robinson, who will make $2.1 million next season, averaged 10.4 points off the bench and shot 37.7 percent from 3-point range this season.
