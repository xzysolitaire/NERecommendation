LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers pitcher Dan Haren underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder Wednesday. The team said the 30-minute procedure on Haren's nonthrowing shoulder was to clean out bursitis and the AC joint. He will begin his rehab in a week and is expected to be ready by spring training. Haren tweeted about the procedure Wednesday and showed he was in good spirits by also making a light-hearted quip. The 34-year-old right-hander had a 13-11 record with a 4.02 ERA this season. Haren had been named the Dodgers' starter for Game 4 of the NL Division Series against the Cardinals, but he didn't pitch when they elected to go with Clayton Kershaw. The Dodgers were eliminated in four games.
