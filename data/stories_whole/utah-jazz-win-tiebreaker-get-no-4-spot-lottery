NEW YORK -- The Utah Jazz have won a tiebreaker with the Boston Celtics, giving them a chance for a better pick in the NBA draft. Both teams finished with 25-57 records. The Jazz will now be slotted fourth in the lottery, with a 10.4 percent chance at the No. 1 pick, while the Celtics will have a 10.3 percent chance. If they or no teams behind them move up, Utah will pick fourth and Boston fifth. The Celtics also will have the No. 17 pick after a tie was broken between Brooklyn and Washington, both 44-38. The Nets owe the pick to Boston from last summer's trade that landed them Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. Chicago (48-34) won a tiebreaker with Toronto at No. 19. The ties were broken Friday through random drawings.
