The Oklahoma City Thunder have traded center Hasheem Thabeet and cash to the Philadelphia 76ers for a protected second-round draft pick in 2015 and a trade exception. Sources briefed on the transaction said Tuesday that the Sixers will receive cash considerations to take on Thabeet's contract. The Sixers, sources said, are expected to immediately waive the former No. 2 overall pick, while Oklahoma City will create a trade exception worth $1.25 million by shipping Thabeet out without taking back any salary. The deal was announced on Tuesday. The Thunder have a year to use the trade exception. Thabeet, the No. 2 pick in the 2009 draft out of UConn, has averaged 2.2 points and 2.7 rebounds per game over five seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers and Thunder. Thabeet, a 7-foot-3 defensive specialist from Tanzania, played in 66 games in 2012 and averaged nearly a block per contest. His playing time was reduced last season when first-round pick Steven Adams emerged as the backup center.
