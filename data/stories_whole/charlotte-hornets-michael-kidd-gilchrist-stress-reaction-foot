The Hornets have announced that forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will miss the next two games of their West Coast road trip with a right foot injury. Kidd-Gilchrist will miss Friday night's game against the Phoenix Suns and Saturday's against the Golden State Warriors with what team officials are calling a stress reaction in his foot. The team says in a release that Kidd-Gilchrist will be reevaluated when the team returns to Charlotte on Sunday. The Hornets also say that guard Lance Stephenson (groin strain), forward Marvin Williams (left knee) and guard Gary Neal (bruised left foot) are questionable Friday. The Hornets are 0-2 on their current four-game West Coast road trip.
