CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao will not play against New Orleans because of a knee injury. Varejao hyperextended and bruised his left knee on Sunday in a loss to Phoenix. The 6-foot-11 Varejao was fitted with a brace on Tuesday, but after he warmed up on the floor, the Cavs said he would not dress against the Pelicans. Tyler Zeller is expected to start in Varejao's place and face New Orleans big man Anthony Davis. The perpetually hustling Varejao had played in all 44 games this season for the Cavs after being plagued by variety of injuries in recent years. He played in just 81 games over the three previous seasons. Varejao averages 8.8 points and leads the Cavs with 10.3 rebounds per game. Also, Carrick Felix could miss eight weeks with a stress fracture in his left knee. The rookie swingman was injured in a D-League game. Felix, a second-round pick, has played six games for Cleveland this season. He has spent the season shuffling between Cleveland and the Canton Charge.
