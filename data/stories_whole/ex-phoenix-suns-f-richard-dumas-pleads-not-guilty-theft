PHOENIX -- Former Phoenix SunsÂ forward Richard Dumas has pleaded not guilty after being charged with eight counts of organized retail theft. The 44-year-old Dumas entered his plea Friday. His next court date is Feb. 14. He was among 151 people arrested in last week's roundup of theft suspects sought in multiple cases in Arizona. Dumas is accused of taking about $800 worth of items from Luke Air Force Base's exchange store while working with a janitorial service. Glendale police say Dumas was seen on store surveillance cameras in September and October 2012 taking cigarettes, alcohol, food, DVDs and shoes. Dumas played for the Suns from 1992 to 1995 and helped Phoenix reach the NBA Finals in 1993. He was waived by the Suns in 1995 after he missed drug testing.
