MIAMI -- Michelle Obama is a big proponent of fitness. The Miami Heat are big fans of the photobombing craze. Combining the two seems like a hit. The first lady and some members of the Heat are starring together in a new video promoting fitness and healthy eating, part of Mrs. Obama's "Let's Move" initiative. The 50-second public service announcement was taped last week when the Heat visited the White House in commemoration of winning last year's NBA championship. Among the highlights: Mrs. Obama, James and Bosh all "crashing" interviews Spoelstra was conducting with Wade and Allen. The first lady also dunked on a toy hoop as the group broke into laughter, and the tape ends with all six munching a healthy snack together. "Pretty good, huh," Mrs. Obama asks. "Mm-hmm," the Heat group mumbled back. Spoelstra -- who, like Mrs. Obama, is a major fitness activist -- said the Heat didn't know they would be starring alongside the first lady in the video. "It was one of the highlights of our last two visits," Spoelstra said. "Wasn't expecting that. We weren't really briefed on what it might be. We thought we might just have an opportunity to meet her and watch her shoot a commercial, and then they said, 'Oh, by the way, here's a quick script. We want you guys in it.' It was a lot of fun." The video collected more than 300,000 views on YouTube in just its first few hours of being released. "It's pretty good, too. It's pretty funny," James said. "She was amazing."
