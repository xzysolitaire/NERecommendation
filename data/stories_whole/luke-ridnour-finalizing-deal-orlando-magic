The Orlando Magic are finalizing an agreement with free-agent point guard Luke Ridnour, sources told ESPN.com. Ridnour averaged 5.0 points and 2.9 assists while splitting 61 games with the Milwaukee Bucks and Charlotte Bobcats last season. The Magic have revamped their point guard position this summer, releasing veteran Jameer Nelson and making a draft-day trade to acquire No. 10 overall pick Elfrid Payton as their player of the future at the position. The Orlando Sentinel earlier reported Ridnour was headed to the Magic.
