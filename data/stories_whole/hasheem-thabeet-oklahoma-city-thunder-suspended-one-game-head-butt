NEW YORK -- Oklahoma City Thunder center Hasheem Thabeet has been suspended one game without pay by the NBA for head-butting the Pelicans' Greg Stiemsma. Thabeet banged his head into Stiemsma's after the pair exchanged shoves during the Thunder's 105-102 loss on Thursday. The NBA says Monday that Thabeet will miss the first game that he is eligible and physically able to play in during the regular season.
