OAKLAND, Calif. -- Oakland Athletics catcher Stephen Vogt is scheduled for surgery on his troublesome right foot Tuesday, while outfielder Brandon Moss is set for surgery on his right hip later this month. Vogt said Friday he would have a procedure to repair a ruptured plantar plate, which kept him from catching down the stretch for the A's. The surgery will be performed by orthopedist Dr. Kenneth Jung in Los Angeles, Vogt said. Oakland's season ended in a 9-8, 12-inning loss in the one-game wild card playoff to the Royals in Kansas City on Sept. 30. Vogt, unable to put constant pressure on the bottom of his painful foot, still contributed at first base and in right field. Vogt, 29, began the season with Triple-A Sacramento before playing his first game with Oakland on June 1 and remaining in the majors the rest of the way. He batted .279 with nine home runs and 35 RBIs in a career-best 84 games. Vogt didn't catch again after July 7. In terms of when he will be ready to begin working out again post-operation, Vogt said, "Hopefully 4-to-6 weeks." A's assistant general manager David Forst said Friday the expectation is still to have Vogt fully healthy by spring training in February. Moss' operation will be Oct. 21 in Nashville, performed by Dr. Thomas Byrd. "We won't know the extent of the surgery until he gets in there and decides what needs to be done," Forst said. The 31-year-old Moss played a career-high 147 games this season, batting .234 with 25 home runs and 81 RBIs. He played 67 games at first base and 56 of his 84 games in the outfield in left field. He was bothered by the hip at times through the season and struggled late in the year. He also received a cortisone shot.
