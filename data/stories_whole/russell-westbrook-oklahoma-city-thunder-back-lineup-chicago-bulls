CHICAGO -- Russell Westbrook is back in Oklahoma City's lineup against the Chicago Bulls after resting his surgically repaired knee the previous night. Westbrook did not play in Sunday's 109-86 loss at home to Dallas -- the Thunder's most lopsided defeat. Resting Westbrook occasionally is part of the Thunder's plan after the point guard's return from his most recent knee surgery, his third procedure since injuring the knee last April during the NBA playoffs. The Mavericks and Bulls games were the first of three back-to-backs on the Thunder schedule by March 25. Why sit out against Dallas and play Monday against Chicago? Russell says it was "a decision we made as a group." Westbrook missed 27 games after the most recent surgery, returning on Feb. 20.
