PHOENIX -- Phoenix Suns broadcaster Tom Chambers has apologized to the NBA team and its fans after being arrested on suspicion of DUI. Scottsdale police say the 54-year-old Chambers, a former Suns star, was pulled over Saturday night after an officer saw a pickup truck weaving in a bicycle lane. A police report says there were two opened bottles of beer inside the vehicle and that Chambers refused to take a field sobriety test. Police say Chambers consented to a blood draw, was booked and was released pending the results. Chambers was a four-time All-Star forward in a 16-year career that ended in 1997. He played for the Suns from 1988 to 1993 and helped Phoenix reach the NBA Finals in 1993. He now works as a studio host for Suns televised games. Suns officials declined comment on the arrest.
