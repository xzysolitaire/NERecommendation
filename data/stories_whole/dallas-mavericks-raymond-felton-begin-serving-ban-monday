The Dallas Mavericks plan for guard Raymond Felton to begin serving his four-game suspension during Monday's game against the Charlotte Hornets, coach Rick Carlisle said. The NBA announced Felton's suspension, which stems from his guilty plea to gun charges in New York from last season, in August. However, Felton was not allowed to serve the suspension until he was healthy and able to play. Felton, a nine-year veteran acquired in a six-player trade with the New York Knicks in June, suffered a high right ankle sprain during the Mavs' second preseason game and only recently returned to practice. If Felton's suspension begins Monday, he would be eligible to make his Dallas debut on Nov. 24 at home against the Indiana Pacers. Felton, who has career averages of 13.1 points and 6.5 assists per game, will join a crowded Mavs backcourt rotation. Jameer Nelson and Monta Ellis are the starting guards for the 7-3 Mavs, and veteran playmakers Devin Harris and J.J. Barea are performing well off the bench. "It's definitely something I look at, but it's also something you've got to figure out once you get on the court," Felton said of his potential role. "Right now, we've got a good rhythm going. We're playing well, so wherever I fit in, wherever Coach puts me in, that's where I fit in."
