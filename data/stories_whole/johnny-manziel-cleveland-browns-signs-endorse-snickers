He still hasn't taken his first pro snap, but Johnny Manziel is racking up the endorsements. The Cleveland Browns quarterback, who has already filmed commercials for McDonald's and Nissan and a digital spot for Nike, has signed on to be the next face of Snickers. A spokesman for Mars Chocolate North America, which owns the brand, confirmed the signing, saying the company has tapped Manziel to appear in its "You're Not You When You're Hungry" campaign. A national TV commercial will be unveiled closer to the NFL season. The Snickers brand, which has been an NFL sponsor since 2002, is the most popular candy bar brand in the world, with more than $3.5 billion in annual global sales. Despite being picked in this year's NFL draft at No. 22, Manziel has been the most talked about player. His jersey has sold better than any other pick.
