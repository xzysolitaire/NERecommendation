CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Miami Heat showed solidarity with the Los Angeles Clippers over the Donald Sterling controversy before Monday night's playoff game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Like the Clippers did on Sunday, the Heat ran out of the tunnel wearing their warmups, huddled at center court and tossed their white shooting T-shirts to the ground. They then went through their pregame routine with their red Heat warmup jerseys inside out, hiding the team's logo. It was a silent protest in response to Sterling's purported comments urging a woman to not bring black people to his team's games. LeBron James and Dwyane Wade had both said in the locker room before the game they weren't sure what they would do to show their support for the Clippers.
