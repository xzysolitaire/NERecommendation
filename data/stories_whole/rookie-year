Philadelphia's Michael Carter-Williams started his NBA career with a near-triple-double against the reigning champs and, according to our panel, will finish his first season as the undisputed Rookie of the Year. The 11th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, Carter-Williams was a bright spot on a 76ers team that was determined to improve its lottery position in 2014 at the expense of winning games. The Sixers dealt away many of their top players, and the results were not pretty, including a 26-game losing streak. Still, Carter-Williams pressed onward, leading all rookies in average scoring (16.7), rebounding (6.1), assists (6.3) and steals (1.9) per game.
