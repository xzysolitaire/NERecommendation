DURHAM, N.C. -- The assault and battery case involving Charlotte Hornets rookie guard P.J. Hairston has been rescheduled for September. Hairston was due to appear in Durham County court Friday on a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery following an altercation with a high school basketball player during a pickup game last month. Police had issued a summons for Hairston but did not arrest him. Bill Thomas, one of Hairston's lawyers, says Hairston had a waiver to miss Friday's appearance. He says the next appearance is scheduled for Sept. 12, though that could ultimately be pushed back to Oct. 3. Kentrell Barkley, a senior at Northern Durham High School, said in court documents Hairston "punched him twice in the head" during a heated basketball game at the Durham YMCA.
