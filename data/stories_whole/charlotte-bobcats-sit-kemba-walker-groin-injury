CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bobcats coach Steve Clifford says point guard Kemba Walker is sitting out Saturday night's game against the Philadelphia 76ers because of a groin injury. Walker was injured in Charlotte's loss Friday night to the Celtics in Boston. Clifford says Walker had an MRI on Saturday that showed no serious problems. He hopes to have Walker back on the floor Monday night when the Bobcats travel to face the Atlanta Hawks. Luke Ridnour will start in Walker's spot, and Jannero Pargo will see additional minutes in a reserve role. Walker is averaging 17.8 points and 6.1 assists per game this season for the Bobcats, currently the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference.
