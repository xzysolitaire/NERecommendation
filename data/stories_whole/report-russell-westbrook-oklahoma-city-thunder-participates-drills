Oklahoma City ThunderÂ guard Russell Westbrook participated in some on-court drills for the first time since undergoing knee surgery earlier this month, according to the Daily Oklahoman. "There were bits and pieces where Russell participated in practice, so that was good," Thunder coach Scott Brooks told the newspaper. "It was good to get everybody out there, working together." The All-Star, who will miss the first four to six weeks of the regular season, needed the operation after experiencing swelling in his right knee, which he injured during last season's playoffs. Westbrook had surgery on the same knee in May to repair a torn lateral meniscus. Previously, Westbrook had been on the court during the portion of practice open to the media, going through light workouts with the training staff, according to the report. Westbrook averaged 23.2 points and 7.4 assists per game last season for the Thunder, who finished with the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs. He was injured in Game 2 of a first-round series against the Houston Rockets, a matchup won by Oklahoma City in six games. Westbrook was hurt April 24 when Rockets rookie Patrick Beverley lunged for a steal as Westbrook stopped to call a timeout in the second quarter. He remained in the game, and it wasn't until two days later that the team said he'd miss the rest of the playoffs.
