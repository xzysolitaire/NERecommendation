EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni said Tuesday that point guard Steve Nash is "going to try and do everything he can to come back" from the back, hamstring and nerve irritation that has limited him the past two seasons, and has no immediate plans to retire. "He's 39, almost 40 years old. I think he's looking at, 'What am I going to do when I'm 50?' But no [he's not thinking of retiring]," D'Antoni said. "Now, whether he can get over this, we'll see. We think he can. We hope he can. But there's no talk of him sitting over there eating bon bons the rest of the way. No." There has been speculation the 17-year veteran might be forced to consider retirement since the Lakers ruled Nash out for a minimum of two weeks with nerve root irritation on Nov. 11. The condition can affect his back, hamstrings or even neck without warning, and it stems from a collision with Portland's Damian Lillard in his second game with the Lakers last season. It has limited Nash to just 22 minutes per game over six games this year. He is the oldest player in the league. The Lakers owe him $9.3 million this season and $9.7 million in 2014. D'Antoni said Nash has been working with his Canadian doctor and trainer, Rick Celebrini, in recent days and has been going "full bore." Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said he's been communicating with Nash as the two 30-somethings try to make their way back from serious injuries this season. "Steve and I have been extremely close through this process," Bryant said. "That's part of our job as teammates is to pick each other up and put them in position where he can still be extremely efficient and extremely successful."
