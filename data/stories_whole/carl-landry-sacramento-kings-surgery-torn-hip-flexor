SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Sacramento Kings power forward Carl Landry will have hip surgery Tuesday and probably miss much of the season. Landry tore a left hip flexor muscle during a recent practice and is expected to miss three to four months. The team said Monday that Dr. William Meyers of Philadelphia will operate. Landry signed a $26 million, four-year contract in July. He averaged 10.8 points and six rebounds in 23.2 minutes off the bench for the Golden State Warriors last season and helped them reach the second round of the playoffs. He opted out of the final year of his two-year, $8 million deal with Golden State last month to become a free agent.
