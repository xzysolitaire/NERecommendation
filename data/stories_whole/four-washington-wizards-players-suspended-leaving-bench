DeJuan Blair, Nene, Daniel Orton and Xavier Silas of the Washington Wizards have each been suspended for one game for leaving their team's bench area in Monday's preseason game against the Chicago Bulls. The four players left the bench during a shoving match between the Bulls' Joakim Noah and the Wizards' Paul Pierce.Â  Noah was fined $15,000 for starting the altercation with 8:57 remaining in the opening quarter Monday by pushing Pierce in the chest. Pierce also was fined $15,000 for poking Noah in the forehead with his index finger. NBA president of basketball operations Rod Thorn handed out the discipline. A Bulls representative said Noah did not want to talk about the matter. The fines and suspensions were handed out after Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau spoke to the media following a two-hour unscheduled practice and the subject was not broached. The NBA said the suspensions will be served by the players during the first regular-season game in which the players are physically able to play. The Wizards open the season against the Miami Heat on Oct. 29.
