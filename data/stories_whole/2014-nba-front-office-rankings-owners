Welcome to #NBAfrontofficerank, our first #NBArank for management. We're continuing our rankings with a look at the league's owners. We'll reveal our final two categories -- presidents/general managers and coaches -- on Thursday and Friday. (Our ranking of all 30 teams' overall management was revealed Tuesday, and can be seen here.) We asked our ESPN Forecast panel to rate every owner, basketball decision-maker and coach from 0 to 10, and we asked the panel to tell us how important each role is.  In particular, we asked the voters to rate each team's ownership in terms of their performance in guiding the franchise to overall on-court success, both in the short and long term.  From there, we simply calculated the ratings to determine the best and worst owners in the NBA. Here's what we found. For a detailed explanation of our findings, click here. Front-Office Rankings: Owners | Top executives | Coaches | Overall
