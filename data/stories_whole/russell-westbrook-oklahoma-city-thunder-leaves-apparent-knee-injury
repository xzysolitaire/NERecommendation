TORONTO -- Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook left Friday's game against the Raptors in the third quarter after spraining his right knee in a two-overtime, 119-118 victory. He did not return but said after the game he felt good and would get it evaluated Saturday. "I'm pain-free," Westbrook said, according to The Oklahoman. "I'm just going to ... get it looked at and go from there." Westbrook, who sat out Thursday's win at Cleveland to rest the knee that was surgically repaired earlier this season, was injured when Toronto's Kyle Lowry collided with him on a pump-fake near the sideline with 7:37 left in the third quarter. After being struck on the knee by Lowry's leg, Westbrook immediately turned and called timeout, bending over in pain. He hobbled along the sideline for a few steps and was tended to briefly by the trainer before walking off the court with help from center Hasheem Thabeet. Westbrook scored 15 points against Toronto before leaving. A three-time All-Star, he came in averaging 21.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 36 games this season. He has been on a minutes restriction since his return from surgery in February.
