INDIANAPOLIS -- Upset by a stream of rumors focused on off-court chemistry issues, Indiana Pacers players are firing back as they approach a vital Game 2 against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. Late Tuesday, All-Star Paul George put a photo on his Instagram account of him fishing with teammates Roy Hibbert and George Hill with the message: "These rumors have got to stop! Its gettin old now and all you that believe them are ignorant! #Brothers" George said Wednesday he wants the distractions hinting at internal problems to end. "I'm just getting tired of the media and these stories," he said. "I'm just putting everything to bed and to rest." As the Pacers have struggled over the past two months, the team had numerous meetings and hinted at chemistry problems -- including Hibbert saying some of his teammates were playing selfishly. It led to a rise in speculation about the team's once-strong togetherness fraying as its cohesion on the court deteriorated. It has especially focused on Hibbert, who is coming off a third scoreless playoff game. "You guys keep making up stories," Hill said. "We're just trying to focus and letting Roy know through all this BS that is going on, the rumors and everything like that, that we're all brothers. This locker room is a tight group and we're going to continue to be there for each other even when people are trying to break it apart." The Pacers lost Game 1 at home on Monday night.
