The Broncos boast a high-powered offense, which finished No. 1 in the NFL last season. Linebacker DeMarcus Ware thinks Denver's defense can keep pace this season by achieving a top ranking of its own. Asked Wednesday about the expectations of the team's defense, Ware said he hopes the Broncos go to uncharted territory when it comes to the franchise's history. "We are trying to be a force to be reckoned with this year, and you already talked about us being an offensive team, but at the end of the day, we are trying to be [No.] 1 and [No.] 1," Ware said. "The best offense in the league and the best defense in the league." The Broncos have been to seven Super Bowls and won two title games. But Denver has never finished a season with the No. 1 defense in yards allowed per game, which is what the NFL uses to statistically rank defenses each year. Last season the Broncos, who were on the wrong end of Seattle's one-sided 43-8 victory in Super Bowl XLVIII in February, finished 19th in total defense but added several big-name players this offseason. Besides Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib and safety T.J. Ward also signed with the Broncos. Broncos general manager John Elway said Wednesday the Broncos must "get to be where we're a complete football team" that's not so dependent on quarterback Peyton Manning to win games "by himself." Ware believes the Broncos' new-look defense will be able to achieve Elway's vision. "I think this is going to be a night-and-day defense from last year," Ware said. "You had guys that were hurt [last year], and have the opportunity to not have any holes in your defense. ... So I think the sky is the limit for us."
