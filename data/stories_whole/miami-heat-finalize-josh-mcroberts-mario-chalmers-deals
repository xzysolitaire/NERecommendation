MIAMI -- The Miami Heat signed free-agent forwards Josh McRoberts and Danny Granger on Monday, and brought back incumbent point guard Mario Chalmers. All three deals were agreed to previously, but they were not signed until the Heat had more pieces of their salary-cap puzzle put into place. McRoberts signed a four-year deal that will pay him $5.3 million next season. Chalmers got a two-year deal that will have him earning about $4 million next season. Granger also has a two-year deal and will make just more than $1 million next season. McRoberts averaged 8.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game for Charlotte last season. Heat president Pat Riley said McRoberts was one of Miami's "main targets" in free agency. "We are delighted that this multifaceted player will help us immensely," Riley said. Chalmers has been with Miami for all six of his pro seasons, helping win two championships. He averaged 9.8 points and 4.9 assists last season, and shot 38 percent from 3-point range. "It's great to have Mario back," Riley said. "We're happy that he wants to continue his career in Miami, he's one of our core players, and I believe he will have a great season." Granger has appeared in 556 career NBA regular-season games, and averaged 17.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.9 assists. He has been bothered by injuries for most of the past two seasons. "One of our main priorities this offseason was obtaining a proven veteran like Danny with All-Star experience," Riley said. "We expect him to be a multiposition player and have a very successful season in our system."
