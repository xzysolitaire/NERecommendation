ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Police are looking for three men suspected of brutally beating a man in the Angel Stadium parking lot in what appears to have been an unprovoked attack. The 43-year-old Huntington Beach man and his relative were walking to a car after the Angels' playoff game against the Kansas City Royals Friday night when they were attacked for no apparent reason, Lt. Bob Dunn said Sunday. Witnesses alerted Anaheim police officers of the incident, and police found the victim unconscious. He was rushed to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. The male relative was not injured. "There is no evidence to suggest that there was an argument or any type of physical altercation prior to the incident in the parking lot," Dunn told the Orange County Register. He said there was no indication the attack had anything to do with team rivalries. He said extra officers were on patrol for the postseason game, "above and beyond what we would deploy at a regular-season game." Angels Stadium is located 30 miles south of Dodgers Stadium, where a San Francisco Giants fan was beaten in 2011 after a game between the rival teams. Bryan Stow, a paramedic from Northern California, suffered brain damage from the beating and is permanently disabled. The violence sparked scrutiny of stadium security and fan behavior.
