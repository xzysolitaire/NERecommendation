The Dallas Mavericks are closing in on signing former Orlando Magic point guard Jameer Nelson, according to sources briefed on the talks. Sources told ESPN.com that Nelson and the Mavericks, barring an unforeseen snag, are on track to formalize a contract Thursday, when Nelson visits Dallas. ESPN.com reported Tuesday that the Mavericks had arranged to fly Nelson into town for a face-to-face visit Thursday in the hopes of finalizing a deal via use of their $2.7 million room exception. Dallas has been in the market for another veteran floor leader all summer to help fill the void created by Jose Calderon's exit in June. The Mavericks had to part with Calderon to reacquire center Tyson Chandler in a trade with the New York Knicks. After initially focusing on Mo Williams, who maintains an offseason home in the Dallas area, Mavericks officials have been engaged in serious negotiations with Nelson over the past week to give coach Rick Carlisle another trusted ball handler. Longtime Maverick Devin Harris is the projected starter at the point after landing a four-year deal worth more than $16 million this month. Newly acquired point guard Raymond Felton and second-year point guard Gal Mekel are also on Dallas' roster, but the Mavericks have made the signing of another point guard their top remaining priority after securing the services of Chandler Parsons as their new starting small forward.
