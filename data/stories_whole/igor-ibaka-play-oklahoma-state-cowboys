OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma City Thunder forward Serge Ibaka's younger brother, Igor, will play for Oklahoma State. Dustin Grover, Igor's coach at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M, said Wednesday that Igor plans to get his associate's degree within the next year, then enroll at Oklahoma State in time to play during the 2015-16 season. He will not play JUCO ball next season because he will be past the age limit. He turns 22 in July. As a freshman last season, the 6-foot-8 center was an All-Region selection after averaging 13.7 points and 9.6 rebounds and shooting 64 percent from the field. Grover said Igor also had offers from Wichita State and Old Dominion, but the fact that Stillwater is about an hour from downtown Oklahoma City was a deciding factor.
