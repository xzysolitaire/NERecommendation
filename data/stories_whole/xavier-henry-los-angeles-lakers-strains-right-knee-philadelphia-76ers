LOS ANGELES -- Lakers guard Xavier Henry suffered a strained right knee late in the first quarter of Sunday night's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers and did not return. Henry is scheduled to undergo an MRI on the knee Monday. Henry went 0-for-2 shooting with one rebound in five minutes before exiting the game with 1:14 to go in the first quarter. He immediately went to the locker room with longtime Lakers trainer Gary Vitti for further evaluation. Henry said in the locker room after the game that he has suffered knee injuries in the past but Sunday's was different, occurring without any contact. "I just landed awkwardly on my leg when I was about to plant," Henry said. He added that his knee "feels weird" and "a little loose," saying that it "kind of buckled" but was only experiencing minimal swelling. "Hopefully it's just a strain," Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni said. Henry had been a bright spot during a mostly frustrating Lakers season so far, averaging 10.4 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists after making the team during training camp on a nonguaranteed deal for the veteran's minimum. The 22-year-old Henry proved even more valuable after the Lakers suffered a rash of injuries to point guards Steve Nash, Steve Blake and Jordan Farmar. A natural wing player at shooting guard or small forward, Henry filled in at backup point guard. "Worse things have happened," he said. "All I can do is go [Monday] to my MRI, see what they say and go on from there. ... I'm not very concerned. This is a plan and I'm just going to follow the course." Kendall Marshall filled in for Henry and had his best performance since being acquired by the Lakers from the D-League five games ago, finishing with eight points, three assists and two turnovers in 17 minutes. "Kendall played well tonight," D'Antoni said. "It was good. We're going to need him, obviously, but he played well. Hopefully he keeps it right there."
