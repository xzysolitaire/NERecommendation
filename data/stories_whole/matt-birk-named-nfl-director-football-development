Matt Birk was named the NFL's director of football development, the league announced Thursday. Birk, a six-time Pro Bowl center and a member of the Baltimore Ravens' 2012 Super Bowl team, was an appeals officer on player discipline last year. In his new role, Birk will assist in developing the game at all levels, from players to coaches to front-office personnel. He will guide the evolution of the NFL scouting combine and regional combines as well as the all-star games for prospects, such as the Senior Bowl and the East-West Shrine Game. Birk will also over see the career development symposium and the Bill Walsh minority coaching fellowship program. "I'm very excited to begin this next chapter of my football career," Birk said. "It's a real honor for me to be entrusted with developing the game in so many different ways." Birk, 37, played his first 11 seasons in the league with the Minnesota Vikings before joining the Ravens for the final four seasons of his career. He retired after he won his first Super Bowl following the 2012 season. In 2011, he was the recipient of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award for his excellence on and off the field.
