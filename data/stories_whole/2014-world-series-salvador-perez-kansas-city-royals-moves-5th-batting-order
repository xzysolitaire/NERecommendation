SAN FRANCISCO -- Catcher Salvador Perez has been moved up two spots to fifth in the Kansas City Royals' batting order for Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night. Third baseman Mike Moustakas was dropped one spot to sixth, bumping second baseman Omar Infante to the seventh slot. Perez will follow first baseman Eric Hosmer. Manager Ned Yost says he made the decision because left-hander Madison Bumgarner, the Game 1 winner, was San Francisco's starting pitcher. Yost says the move splits up lefty batters Moustakas and Hosmer. He also says Perez got moved up because he had "pretty good" at-bats against Bumgarner in Game 1.
