ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Orlando Magic have exercised team options and extended the contracts of general manager Rob Hennigan and coach Jacque Vaughn. Magic CEO Alex Martins announced the contract extensions on Friday. Both contracts will now run through the 2015-16 season. Terms of the deals were not released. "Rob and Jacque have worked extremely hard in establishing a culture which embodies teamwork, hard work, hunger for success and humility," Martins said in a statement. "With their strategic direction and leadership we feel we are headed in the right direction, which will allow us to achieve our goals of contending in a long-term, sustainable fashion." Hennigan was named the team's GM in June 2012, and Vaughn became the team's 10th coach when he was hired the next month. The Magic finished 23-59 this season. The team has two lottery picks in the upcoming draft.
