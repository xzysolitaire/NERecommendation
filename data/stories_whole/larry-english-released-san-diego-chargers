The San Diego Chargers released outside linebacker Larry English, a former first-round draft pick, on Tuesday. English, 28, was selected No. 16 overall in the 2009 draft by former Chargers general manager A.J. Smith. San Diego attempted to convert English, a defensive end at Northern Illinois, to outside linebacker, with mixed results. Injuries limited English to 52 games in five seasons for the Chargers, in which he recorded 82 tackles and 11 sacks. His 2013 season was cut short after he suffered a torn biceps while sacking Peyton Manning in a 28-20 loss to Denver in Week 10. "We'd like to thank Larry for his five years of dedicated service to the Chargers," general manager Tom Telesco said in a prepared statement. "Larry always gave us everything he had on the field while making significant contributions to many deserving organizations in the San Diego community." English was scheduled to earn a little more than $1.5 million in base salary in 2014 -- the final year of his rookie contract. The Chargers are deep at edge rusher, with Dwight Freeney, Jarret Johnson, Melvin Ingram and rookie Jeremiah Attaochu expected to see the bulk of time at outside linebacker. Thomas Keiser, Cordarro Law and Tourek Williams also provide depth at the position, making English expendable. By releasing him now, the Chargers gave English a chance to make another roster at the opening of training camp. As a five-year veteran, English will not be subject to waivers and can sign with any team.
