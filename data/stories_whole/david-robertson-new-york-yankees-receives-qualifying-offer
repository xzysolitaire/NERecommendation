NEW YORK -- The Yankees made closer David Robertson a $15.3 million qualifying offer prior to Monday's 5 p.m. deadline. Robertson will have one week to decide if he wants to accept it. He could become the first major leaguer to take the offer because, on the open market, it is doubtful that he could find a $15.3 million salary for one season. Robertson will ultimately have to weigh the risk of making the larger salary in 2015 with no guarantees for the future with the security of a longer deal for a lesser annual average value.  Robertson, 29, made $5.25 million in 2014. The highest-paid reliever in 2014 was Rafael Soriano at $14 million. The Yankees would be interested in signing Robertson to a multiyear deal, but no agreement is presently close, a person briefed on the discussions said.  If the Yankees go through with their plan to offer Robertson the qualifying offer and he leaves as a free agent, they would be eligible for a first-round pick as compensation. In 2014, replacing Mariano Rivera, Robertson had a fine season, converting 39 of 44 save opportunities with an ERA of 3.08 and a WHIP of 1.06. He struck out more than 13 batters per nine innings. Batters hit just .192 against him. If Robertson were to leave via free agency, the Yankees could promote Dellin Betances to the closer role. Betances was an All-Star as a rookie, striking out 135 batters in 90 innings. Ideally, the Yankees would like to keep Betances as a one- or two-inning setup option to team with Robertson.
