OXNARD, Calif. -- With the long-term view on the regular season,Â Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo said he will play some in the preseason, but perhaps not the Aug. 7 opener against the San Diego Chargers. "You're constantly evaluating it and you're constantly, I don't want to say adjusting because you stick to the plan, but it's a progression," Romo said. "It's leading up to San Francisco [on Sept. 7 for the season opener]. I am going to play in the preseason, obviously. I think it's important. The first game, we'll talk about it as we move into the weekend." After having surgery to remove a cyst from his back last year, Romo did not play in the 2013 preseason opener in the Hall of Fame Game against the Miami Dolphins. He saw action in the second preseason game, completing six of eight passes for 88 yards in two drives. Romo returned to practice on Wednesday after sitting out Tuesday's afternoon session as he continues to monitor his training camp work because of back surgery last December. Romo plans on practicing again Thursday with the Cowboys scheduled for an off day on Friday. He said the start to training camp has gone the way he expected. "It's just a little unknown so you'd rather play it safe than be silly and just go out and do everything over and over again and all of a sudden have to sit out for a week or so," Romo said. "I think more than anything we're playing the long game and I think that's smart." Romo goes through a time-consuming daily process to help maintain strength in and around his back. He said he sits in a cold tub three times a day, "which isn't fun." He gets laser treatments. He strengthens his glutes, hamstring and abdominal muscles every day. "But that doesn't mean you can't do the things that it takes to be successful on the field or whatever you want to do," Romo said. "There's been plenty of people who've done it. You just got to go do it. It just takes work."
