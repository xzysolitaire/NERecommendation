Free agent point guard Mario Chalmers wants to stay put and help the Miami Heat try to get back to the NBA Finals for a fifth consecutive season. "I hope we stay together," Chalmers told Yahoo! Sports. "I think we have a good thing going." Chalmers' status is just one of the many questions facing the Heat, even if the Big Three -- LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh -- decide to opt out and return with new deals to create financial flexibility for team president Pat Riley to bring in new pieces. Bosh told The Associated Press that the Big Three want to stay intact, while James has said that the Heat "need to get better from every facet, every position." Chalmers, whose production dipped significantly during the postseason, wound up losing his starting job for Game 5 as the San Antonio Spurs went on to win the NBA championship on Sunday. He averaged 6.4 points and 3.6 assists during the postseason. During the season, he had averaged 9.8 points and 4.9 assists. The status of the team's other key players also is unclear as Ray Allen ponders retirement, Chris Andersen mulls whether he'll opt out of his deal, and Rashard Lewis enters free agency. Shane Battier has already said he is retiring.
