BOSTON -- Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo will not accompany the team to Chicago for Saturday night's game and instead will undergo a minor surgical procedure to remove a screw that was inserted into his left hand in late September. Rondo played a season-low 28 minutes during Friday's 101-98 win over the Indiana Pacers. It was his quietest performance of the season, as he posted eight points, six assists and four rebounds. Rondo underwent a surgical fixation of the third metacarpal on his left hand after slipping in the shower in late September. The team initially offered a recovery timeline of six to eight weeks, but Rondo returned for opening night last month, less than five weeks after the procedure. The team maintained that it was encouraged by the way the bone was healing, and it would appear this is merely a measure to remove the screw that was inserted and potentially relieve any discomfort it could be causing. The Celtics have three days off after Saturday's game. Rondo is averaging 9 points, 11.2 assists and 8 rebounds over 33.2 minutes per game this season. On Wednesday, he registered his first triple-double of the season in a loss to the Toronto Raptors.
