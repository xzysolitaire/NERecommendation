CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bobcats coach Steve Clifford says Anthony Tolliver will start at small forward Monday night against the Golden State Warriors. Tolliver replaces Jeff Taylor, who is out with a left heel contusion. Taylor took over as the Bobcats starter at small forward last week after Michael Kidd-Gilchrist broke his left hand. Kidd-Gilchrist is out four to six weeks; Taylor is day to day. That leaves Charlotte thin at small forward. Clifford says "if anyone else gets hurt I'll have to play. And that won't be pretty." Clifford says backup center Bismack Biyombo is also out for Charlotte with a right ankle sprain. Warriors coach Mark Jackson says he will make a game-time decision on the status of guard Toney Douglas, who has been dealing with a left tibia injury.
