OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State shooting guard Klay Thompson started Tuesday night after missing one game with a sprained right hand and led the Warriors with 29 points in a 113-100 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Thompson added five rebounds, four assists and a steal while playing 40 minutes. He was 9-of-17 from the floor, including 5-of-6 from 3-point range. He missed the first game of his four-year career Sunday, a 107-95 loss to the Phoenix Suns. Warriors coach Steve Kerr had said Thompson would not be on a minutes limit against the Spurs.
