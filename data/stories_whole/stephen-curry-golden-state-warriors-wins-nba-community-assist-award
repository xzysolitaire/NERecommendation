OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry has won the NBA's 2013-14 Kia Community Assist Seasonlong Award. The league recognized Curry on Wednesday for "his numerous charitable contributions, fundraising and remarkable generosity in the Bay Area and across the globe." Curry's charity of choice, ThanksUSA, will receive $25,000 from the NBA and Kia Motors. ThanksUSA provides college, technical and vocational school scholarships for children and spouses of active-duty military personnel. Curry has served as a spokesman for the charity since 2010. Curry's other charitable works included distributing 38,000 bed nets in Tanzania last summer with the "Nothing But Nets" campaign. Curry also helped raise money for the fight against malaria in Africa by donating three bed nets for every 3-pointer he made during the last two seasons.
