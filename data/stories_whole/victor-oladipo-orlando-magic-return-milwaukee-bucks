MILWAUKEE -- Orlando Magic guard Victor Oladipo returned Monday night in a 105-98 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks after missing two games because of a sore left ankle, scoring 12 points in 19 minutes. Coach Jacque Vaughn said the rookie will come off the bench against Milwaukee, and that he didn't know how many minutes he would give Oladipo. Drafted second overall out of Indiana, Oladipo is averaging 13.9 points, 4.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.63 steals in 62 games, making 37 starts.
