PHOENIX -- The Arizona Diamondbacks say Kevin Towers has told the team that he is leaving the organization. Friday's announcement by the team of Towers' departure comes a month after he was stripped of his general manager title. He has been replaced by Dave Stewart. The Diamondbacks also said that the contract of assistant general manager Billy Ryan will not be renewed. In a statement, team President Derrick Hall said that for Towers to remain would have created an "awkwardness" with the new management. The Diamondbacks named Stewart general manager last week. The team is searching for a replacement for fired manager Kirk Gibson.
