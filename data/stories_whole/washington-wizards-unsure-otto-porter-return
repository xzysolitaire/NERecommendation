WASHINGTON -- Washington Wizards coach Randy Wittman is not sure when first-round draft pick Otto Porter will be able to play -- or even practice with his teammates. Porter has been sidelined since the start of training camp with a right hip flexor injury. He was the No. 3 overall choice in the NBA draft after being an All-American at Georgetown. Before Washington's game against the New York Knicks on Saturday night, Wittman says: "When is that day going to be when he steps on the practice court? I still don't know." Wittman adds, however, that Porter is "doing more and more stuff individually." There "was never a setback" for Porter, Wittman says, noting a hip injury is one that "different people heal differently from."
