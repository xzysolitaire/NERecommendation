Detroit Pistons guard Jodie Meeks will be sidelined approximately eight weeks due to a stress reaction in his lower back, the team announced Tuesday. The injury was diagnosed through a CT scan performed Monday by the team's medical staff. Meeks had originally been diagnosed with back spasms on Oct. 9. Meeks signed a $19.5 million, three-year deal with the Pistons this offseason. He averaged 15.7 points per game in 77 games with the Los Angeles Lakers last season and has career averages of 9.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.1 assists and 24.3 minutes in 355 games (194 starts). He scored 13 points and added four rebounds in his preseason debut against the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 7. He joins Will Bynum (right hamstring) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (knee strain) as Pistons guards dealing with injuries.
