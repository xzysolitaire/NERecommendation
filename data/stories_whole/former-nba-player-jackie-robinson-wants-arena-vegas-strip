LAS VEGAS -- A former NBA player says he wants to build a $1.3 billion arena and hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Las Vegas basketball player and businessman Jackie Robinson announced the project this week. It's tentatively called the All Net Arena and Resort, and would be built on the site of a former water park near the renovated SLS Las Vegas hotel-casino and the Fontainebleau tower. Robinson says the project is privately funded. He says construction could begin next spring and be completed in 2016. The 22,000-seat stadium would be the second new arena on the tourist corridor. MGM Resorts International is partnering with sports and entertainment promoter AEG on another arena on the other side of the Strip.
