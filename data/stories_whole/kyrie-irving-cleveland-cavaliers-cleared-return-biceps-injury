CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving has been cleared to return to practice after missing eight games with a biceps injury. Irving strained his left biceps on March 16 against the Clippers. He can resume full contact immediately, but the Cavs said his status for important games this week at Orlando and Atlanta has not been determined. Cleveland is 4-4 since its leading scorer was injured. The Cavs, who enter the week just 2Â½ games behind Atlanta for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, will likely ease Irving back into the lineup. Also, an MRI on forward Anderson Varejao's shoulder revealed a sprained AC joint. The 6-foot-11 Varejao will not play Wednesday against the Magic and the team said his status beyond that will be updated later.
