EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- A security guard at the Los Angeles Lakers' training center has been charged with stealing two NBA championship rings that disappeared last week. El Segundo police said in a statement Thursday that Eddie J. Monterroso has been charged with felony grand theft and burglary. He's accused of taking the rings and gift cards valued at nearly $20,000. The statement says detectives began investigating the theft Dec. 5 and arrested Monterroso outside the practice facility Tuesday. Police say they searched Monterroso's Inglewood home and found the rings from the Lakers' 2009 and 2010 championship seasons. Police could not say to whom the rings belonged. Monterroso has not entered a plea, and police didn't know if he has an attorney. A phone message left at a possible home number was not immediately returned.
