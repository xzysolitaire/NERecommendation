BOSTON -- Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo is in the starting lineup for Wednesday's season opener against the Brooklyn Nets, returning to game action less than five weeks after undergoing surgery for a fracture in his left hand. Rondo had playfully declared himself a nap-time decision on Tuesday. It appears the afternoon slumber was a success. "Nap was pretty long and when I woke up I was like, 'OK, I'm playing,'" said Rondo. Rondo, who missed the entire exhibition slate, is not expected to be limited in any capacity, though coach Brad Stevens did say he'd attempt to play Rondo in shorter stints while he gets his conditioning back up. Rondo has appeared in only 68 games over the past two seasons after an ACL tear. The team has stressed that Rondo's knee is completely healthy now and, with the medical staff convinced the bone in his left hand has healed sufficiently, they have given the necessary clearance to get Rondo back on the court. How does Rondo's return change things for the Celtics? "It doesn't change anything," said Stevens. "This has been the plan all along, to play this way with Rondo. He's been able to do 5-on-0 and been able to do things like that for a couple weeks now. And he's been able to do contact, really, since last Thursday with a pretty heavy pad on Thursday and Friday. He's as up to speed as he can be." Added Stevens: "He's been here every day and I think he's ready to roll. And he's obviously anxious to play." Rondo is expected to wear a pad over the injury to prevent it from absorbing contact.Â He joked that reporters would have to zoom in with their cameras to identify exactly what sort of protection he is wearing to protect the injury.
