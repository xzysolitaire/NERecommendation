The Los Angeles Clippers have inquired about trading for Ryan Anderson, but the New Orleans Pelicans aren't making him available, according to sources close to the process. Sources told ESPN.com Thursday that the Pelicans, after agreeing to a deal in principle to trade for Houston Rockets center Omer Asik, want to bring Asik in to form a three-man frontcourt rotation with Anderson and face-of-the-franchise Anthony Davis. Anderson, 26, averaged 19.8 points and 6.5 rebounds for the Pelicans in a season blighted by injury. Clippers coach and president Doc Rivers is said to see Anderson as an ideal fit with his 3-point shooting ability; Anderson made 41 percent of his shots from beyond the arc in 2013-14. But the Pelicans have shown no inclination to move Anderson even after striking a deal for Asik, who will be absorbed into cap space next month in exchange for a protected first-round pick in 2015. Another interesting dynamic between these teams is that there is some sentiment within the Clippers' organization to pursue Rivers' son, Austin. In his second NBA season, Austin Rivers averaged 7.7 points for the Pelicans. Rivers, however, told ESPN last season that he would not be comfortable coaching his son.
