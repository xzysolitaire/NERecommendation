ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Texas Rangers have acquired infielder Ed Lucas from the Miami Marlins on a waiver claim. The Rangers got the 32-year-old Lucas on Friday. Lucas hit .251 with one home run and nine RBIs in 69 games for Miami last season. He played all four infield spots, and also saw time in left field and right field. Lucas began last year on the disabled list because of a broken left hand. He made his major league debut in 2013 with the Marlins and hit .256 with four homers and 28 RBIs in 94 games.
