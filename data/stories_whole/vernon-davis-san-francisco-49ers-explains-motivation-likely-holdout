Vernon Davis has added intrigue to the question of whether he will show up for the San Francisco 49ers' mandatory minicamp, which starts Tuesday. Writing a guest column for Sports Illustrated's MMQB, Davis detailed why he has stayed away from the 49ers' voluntary sessions and even mentioned the word "holdout." He can't officially become a holdout until he misses a mandatory session. The 49ers can start fining him Tuesday if he is not present. "In 2010 I signed a five-year, $37 million contract extension with $23 million guaranteed. It was the biggest contract for a tight end in league history," Davis wrote. "Four years later, and I'm playing at a higher level than I was then, which brings me to why I'm holding out. It's all about getting paid what you deserve. It's not that complicated. I want the 49ers to win the Super Bowl, and I want to be on the field this summer working towards that goal, but I have to worry about my future first." Davis' stance on Monday appears to contradict what he's said in the past. On Thursday, he told a San Francisco radio station: "You know what? I plan on being there. I plan on being there." And on June 5, Davis told ESPN.com: "If it's mandatory, I think I should be there. My foot could get stuck in the grass, and I may not be able to get out ... but if it's mandatory, I think I should be there." After his latest words, it appears Davis, at the very least, is wavering on his decision. One Niner who isn't wavering is guard Alex Boone. According to a league source, Boone will not be at the minicamp because he wants a new contract and is willing to start his holdout. He has not been at voluntary offseason sessions. His contract runs out in 2015.
