CLEVELAND -- Carlos Boozer (left calf strain) and Kirk Hinrich (hamstring) will not play Wednesday night against the Cavaliers, Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. Both injuries occurred Monday during Chicago's overtime win against the Los Angeles Lakers, but Hinrich's is the one the Bulls are most worried about. The veteran guard has dealt with myriad injuries the past few seasons, and Thibodeau acknowledged that Hinrich would likely be out at least a few games. Hinrich didn't travel with the team to Cleveland. "He's getting treatment," Thibodeau said. "It will probably be about a week ... we're hopeful that it's shorter but we want to make sure it's right." Thibodeau called Boozer's injury more "day to day." The forward didn't sound too concerned about missing much action. "It will be a couple days, then I'll be right back at it," Boozer said. With Hinrich out, D.J. Augustin is expected to take his place in the starting lineup. The Bulls also officially re-signed journeyman Mike James to a 10-day contract. It was a move that seemed to please Thibodeau. "Always ready Mike," Thibodeau said. "That's really who he is. Mike is going to be in a gym every day. When we let him go, he's in the gym with John Lucas every day. So you know he's always ready. He knows our system. He's got experience, he's got a lot of toughness, so we're glad that he was available." Knowing it was possible he could return to the Bulls, James stayed prepared. "The older you get, the first question they ask you is, 'Are you in shape?'" he said. "And so I've always prided myself on being in shape. I've prided myself on my work ethic. "So my shape is never my issue. It was about getting my body back 100 percent, it was about the right situation. [The Bulls] called me; no other teams was calling me. No other teams was giving me the opportunity. So Chicago, they called, and the opportunity's here."
