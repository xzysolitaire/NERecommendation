NC State sophomore forwardÂ T.J. Warren is heading to the NBA, sources confirmed to ESPN. Wolfpack coach Mark Gottfried told Andy Katz of ESPN.com on Monday that Warren "has not decided yet" and will meet with his family Thursday to discuss the matter. The 6-foot-8 Warren averaged 24.9 points and 7.1 rebounds this season and won ACC Player of the Year honors. He is considered a first-round selection and could wind up being a lottery pick, multiple NBA executives told ESPN. The news was earlier reported by Yahoo! Sports.
