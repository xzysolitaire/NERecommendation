Orlando Magic rookie Aaron Gordon will be out indefinitely after fracturing a bone in his left foot, general manager Rob Hennigan said Sunday. Gordon, 19, was the No. 4 overall pick in the 2014 draft. He referred to the injury on Twitter as a stress fracture. Gordon injured the foot during Saturday night's loss to the Wizards. He underwent an X-ray and will be further evaluated. The Magic took to social media to gather fans' well-wishes for Gordon's recovery. The 6-foot-9 reserve has averaged 5.8 points and 3.0 rebounds while playing in all 11 games.
