The DEA has launched an investigation into potential painkiller abuse in the NFL, the New York Daily News reported Saturday, citing three sources familiar with the probe. Federal authorities want to find out how NFL doctors and trainers access prescription painkillers and who distributes them to players, according to the Daily News report. The investigation began shortly after a group of retired players filed a lawsuit accusing the NFL of distributing prescription narcotics without telling players of the drugs' effects. The lawsuit, filed in May, represents about 1,300 players, including Jim McMahon, Richard Dent and ESPN analyst Marcellus Wiley. The NFL declined comment on the report of the Drug Enforcement Administration's investigation. A DEA spokeswoman said she was not aware of an investigation into prescription drug abuse in NFL locker rooms but said generally speaking the DEA is involved in efforts to reduce painkiller abuse.
