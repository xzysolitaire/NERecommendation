SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs general manager R.C. Buford attempted to trade up in the NBA draft to acquire Andrew Wiggins or Jabari Parker. It's just that no one wanted Tim Duncan in a trade. The tongue-in-cheek revelation was made by Buford late Thursday after he was asked if anyone other than UCLA forward Kyle Anderson was their top choice. The Spurs selected the 6-foot-9 forward with their first-round pick, No. 30 overall. "Yeah, Wiggins and Parker were No. 1 on our board," Buford said. So, the Spurs attempted to trade up? "Yeah, but just didn't figure out a way to get it done," Buford said. Cleveland took Wiggins, the Kansas star, with the first overall pick. Milwaukee used the next pick on Parker, the standout at Duke. So, neither team wanted Duncan? "Exactly," Buford said, laughing. "No matter how badly he wants to play for (Philadelphia coach and former Spurs assistant) Brett Brown, we just couldn't make it work. If Philly could have gotten one, we would have traded him to Brett." Duncan, who has exercised his $10.4 million player option to return for a 19th season, has led San Antonio to five NBA championships since being drafted first overall in 1997.
