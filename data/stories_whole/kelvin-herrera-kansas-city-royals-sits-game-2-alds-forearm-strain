ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Kansas City reliever Kelvin Herrera has a flexor strain in his right forearm, and he was unavailable for the Royals' 4-1, 11-inning win in Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Royals manager Ned Yost said he was optimistic Herrera could pitch in Game 3 at Kansas City on Sunday. The reliever will be re-evaluated when the teams get to Kansas City. Herrera threw just five pitches in the seventh inning of Game 1 before leaving with tightness in his forearm. Yost said an MRI exam was encouraging but revealed the strain. Kansas City won the series opener 3-2 in 11 innings. The 24-year-old Dominican reliever with a 100 mph fastball was the seventh-inning specialist in the Royals' dominant bullpen this season. He went 4-3 with a 1.41 ERA in 70 appearances, striking out 59 in 70 innings.
