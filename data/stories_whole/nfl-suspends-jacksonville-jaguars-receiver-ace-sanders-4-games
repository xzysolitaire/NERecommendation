JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The NFL has suspended Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Ace Sanders without pay for the first four games of the season for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. The league handed down the punishment Wednesday, one day after Sanders disclosed it was coming and said he would not appeal. On a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Sanders said "personal issues" caused his misstep. He said he has "been dealing with a lot of stuff, just with life and family and a lot of issues going on." A second-year pro from South Carolina, Sanders said he plans to seek counseling and not rehab. Sanders will be eligible to return to the team's active roster Sept. 29, after sitting out games against Philadelphia, Washington, Indianapolis and San Diego. He is eligible to participate in training camp and preseason games.
