Caron Butler has agreed to sign a deal with the Detroit Pistons, according to a source. The source told ESPN.com that the deal is for two years in the range of $10 million. Butler played last season with the Oklahoma City Thunder. New Pistons teammate Andre Drummond took to Twitter to welcome Butler, and Butler responded. Both Drummond and Butler are former Connecticut Huskies.  The deal will reunite Butler with new Detroit president/coach Stan Van Gundy, under whom he played in Miami early in his career. The Pistons also agreed to a two-year, $6 million deal with point guard D.J. Augustin, sources close to the situation told The Associated Press. Augustin, 26, averaged 13.1 points per game and made 40 percent of his 3-pointers for the Chicago Bulls after the team claimed him off waivers from the Toronto Raptors this past season.
