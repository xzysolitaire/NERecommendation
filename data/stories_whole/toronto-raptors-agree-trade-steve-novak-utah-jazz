The Toronto Raptors have agreed to trade 3-point specialist Steve Novak to the Utah Jazz, sources confirmed to ESPN.com. The Raptors also will send a future second-round draft pick to the Jazz, who will ship guard Diante Garrett to Toronto. The trade cannot become official until the league's moratorium lifts Thursday. Novak appeared to confirm the trade on Twitter, writing: Yahoo! Sports first reported the agreement earlier Friday. The website said Garrett, who has a nonguaranteed $915,000 deal for 2014-15, will be waived by the Raptors after the deal is official. The two-year veteran out of Iowa State averaged 3.5 points in 14.8 minutes per game for the Jazz last season. Novak, meanwhile, has two years and $7.2 million left on his contract but had little effectiveness in only 10 minutes per game during his one season with Toronto. The 31-year-old small forward originally was dealt to Toronto in the trade that sent center Andrea Bargnani to the New York Knicks last July. Novak, who has played for six teams in an eight-year career, has averaged 5.0 points per game and 43 percent from 3-point range for his career.
