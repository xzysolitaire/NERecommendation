DENVER -- Nuggets guard Nate Robinson left Wednesday night's game against the Charlotte Bobcats in the first quarter with a left knee injury. Robinson had started the game in place of injured point guard Ty Lawson, who remains day to day after suffering a left rotator cuff strain in Sunday night's game at Sacramento. The Nuggets said Robinson would not return to the game and was scheduled to undergo an MRI on Thursday to evaluate the injury, which the team initially described as a sprain. Robinson apparently was hurt in a spill underneath the Nuggets' basket. He got up gingerly and continued playing, but was forced to leave the game a short time later.
