SAN FRANCISCO -- Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton expects to have a normal offseason of conditioning as he recovers from his facial injuries. Stanton was struck under the left eye by a fastball from Milwaukee's Mike Fiers on Sept. 11, ending his season. He sustained facial fractures, dental damage, cuts that required stitches and two black eyes. He attended Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday to accept the Hank Aaron Award, given by Major League Baseball to the top offensive performer in each league. He did not appear to have any signs of black eyes. "It was a long process of just kind of laying around the house, and not being able to leave too much," Stanton said. "But I feel great now, and I'll be back to my normal offseason routine and shouldn't skip a beat." Stanton won the NL Hank Aaron Award. Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, who won in the AL, did not attend.
