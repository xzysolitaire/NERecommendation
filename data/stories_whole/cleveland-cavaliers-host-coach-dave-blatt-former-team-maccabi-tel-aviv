CLEVELAND -- New Cavaliers coach David Blatt will face his former team from Israel in an exhibition game. One of Europe's top coaches, Blatt was hired last week by the Cavs. He'll coach against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Oct. 5 as this year's Euroleague champions begin their U.S. tour against Cleveland at Quicken Loans Arena. Maccabi will play at Brooklyn two nights later. Blatt spent six seasons coaching at Maccabi. He signed a three-year deal with the Cavs on Friday, ending the club's 39-day search for their third coach in three years. The 55-year-old Blatt will be introduced at a news conference Wednesday. Blatt is the first European coach to make the jump to the NBA. He led Russia to a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics.
