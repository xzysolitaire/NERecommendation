ATLANTA -- Hawks point guard Jeff Teague is expected to miss at least two games after suffering a sprained left ankle against San Antonio on Friday night. Teague, who hurt his ankle when he came down on Tim Duncan's foot, limped off the court late in the second period and did not return in the Spurs' 105-79 win. Hawks coach Mike Budenhozer said Teague will not be with the team for a two-game trip to Milwaukee and Oklahoma City. The Hawks play at Milwaukee on Saturday night. "We will hope that Jeff recovers quickly," Budenholzer said. Budenholzer said Shelvin Mack, rookie Dennis Schroder and Lou Williams will have to fill the void at point guard. Even with Teague, the Hawks had only 10 players in uniform. They played their first game after losing center Pero Antic for two to four weeks with a stress fracture in his right ankle. Antic had been the replacement for Al Horford, who was lost for the season when he tore his right pectoral muscle on Dec. 26. Forward DeMarre Carroll was held out with a mild strain to his left hamstring. Budenholzer said the Hawks can't focus on the injuries. "I think nobody else in the league cares if there's a mounting toll or what our injury status is," Budenholzer said.
