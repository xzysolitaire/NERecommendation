PHOENIX -- The NBA has suspended Phoenix Suns forward P.J. Tucker for three games following his guilty plea to "super extreme" driving while intoxicated. The suspension will be served at the beginning of the coming season. Tucker was sentenced to three days in jail and 11 days' home detention following his plea last week. "Super extreme" DUI under Arizona law is for persons whose blood alcohol level exceeds .20 percent. Police say that just after his May 10 arrest in Scottsdale, Tucker had a blood alcohol level of .222. The legal limit in Arizona is .08. Tucker has apologized to fans and said he is taking the necessary steps to address his problem. He signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract in July.
