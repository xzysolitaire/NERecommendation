The issue, which hits newsstands July 11, is ESPN The Magazine's annual celebration of the athletic form. "We somehow manage to raise the bar each year," said ESPN The Magazine and ESPN.com editor in chief Chad Millman. "This year's collection of exceptional athletes and stunning photography showcases an array of sports and body types. It inhabits our mission to pay tribute to these athletes' bodies and all they are capable of." The list of athletes in this year's issue includes Olympic gold-medal-winning snowboarder Jamie Anderson, tennis player Tomas Berdych, Olympic bronze-medal-winning bobsledder Aja Evans, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and U.S. World Cup soccer player Omar Gonzalez, who also plays on the Los Angeles Galaxy. Also on the list are professional surfer Coco Ho, boxer Bernard Hopkins (the oldest title winner in the sport's history), cliff diver Ginger Huber, Olympic hockey player Hilary Knight, WNBA All-Star Angel McCoughtry and the husband-wife team of X Games stars Travis Pastrana and Lyn-Z.
