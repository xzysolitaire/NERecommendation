LOS ANGELES -- Lakers guard Ronnie Price has been suspended one game by the NBA after hitting New Orleans Pelicans guard Austin Rivers in the side of the head with a forearm during a drive to the basket, the league announced Thursday. The play occurred with 9:11 left in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's 109-102 Pelicans win in New Orleans, when Price made contact with Rivers as the Pelicans guard elevated for a layup. Price was assessed a Flagrant 2 Foul and was ejected from the game. The Lakers already had a thin bench with Steve Nash (back) and Julius Randle (leg) out for the season, and with Nick Young and Ryan Kelly out with injuries, but it was further stressed when guard Wayne Ellington was given an indefinite leave of absence after his father was shot and killed Sunday. Because of those circumstances, the 1-7 Lakers, who face the San Antonio Spurs at Staples Center on Friday night, had only 10 active players in their game against the Pelicans.
