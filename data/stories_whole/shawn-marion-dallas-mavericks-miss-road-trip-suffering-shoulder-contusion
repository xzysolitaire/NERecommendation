SAN ANTONIO -- Dallas Mavericks forward Shawn Marion will not join the team on a two-game road trip after suffering a right shoulder contusion and bruised upper ribs in Tuesday's win against the Los Angeles Lakers. X-rays were negative. Coach Rick Carlisle said he wasn't certain about a timetable for Marion's return. "He's banged up," said Carlisle, whose team faces the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night and New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night. "He's in an uncomfortable state right now. He's hurting, but to my knowledge, there was no serious things from the diagnostic tests. He's just got some bad bruises from hitting the floor hard." The Spurs will be without sixth man Manu Ginobili (tight left hamstring) and center Tiago Splitter (sprained right shoulder) against the Mavs. Marion, who was wearing a sling as he left the American Airlines Center, has not been available for comment since suffering the injury. The Mavs originally announced the shoulder injury Tuesday night and updated to include the bruised ribs Wednesday. The injury occurred late in the second quarter when Marion crashed to the floor after getting his feet tangled up with Los Angeles' Pau Gasol and Mavs teammate Dirk Nowitzki while playing defense. He stayed down for about a minute and was escorted to the locker room by an athletic trainer immediately after getting to his feet and did not return to the game. "He took a hard fall," Nowitzki said. "We're kind of glad nothing serious happened. He didn't break anything, as I heard, so that's good news. Hopefully, he'll be back soon." Marion, a 15-year veteran and Dallas' best defender, is averaging 11.3 points and 7.2 rebounds per game this season. Wayne Ellington, who has played sparingly this season, replaced Marion in the lineup at the beginning of the second half. Second-year forward Jae Crowder also will likely play more minutes while Marion is sidelined.
