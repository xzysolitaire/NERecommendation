The Chicago Cubs agreed to terms with left-handed starter Tsuyoshi Wada on a one-year contract, the team announced Monday. Wada, 33, went 4-4 with a 3.25 ERA in 2014 after signing a minor league deal before the season. He was Triple-A Iowa's best pitcher for much of the year, going 10-6 after a rough spring training. Wada is expected to compete for a bottom-of-the-rotation spot with the Cubs in 2015. The deal is for $4 million.
