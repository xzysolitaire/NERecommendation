LOS ANGELES -- The Clippers re-signed forward Hedo Turkoglu, the team announced Friday. Terms were not disclosed but sources said it was a one-year, veteran's minimum contract. "We are happy to welcome Hedo back to the Clippers," Clippers president of basketball operations and head coach Doc Rivers said. "Hedo is a versatile, veteran presence who contributed to the championship culture we are building in Los Angeles." Turkoglu, 35, appeared in 38 games for the Clippers last season after being signed on January 10. He averaged 3.0 points and 2.3 rebounds in 10.3 minutes per game. The signing puts the Clippers roster at 14 players with less than three weeks left before the start of training camp. The Clippers are also close to finalizing their coaching staff. Former New York Knicks coach Mike Woodson joined Rivers' coaching staff, which lost three assistant coaches this offseason, in July. He is expected to be joined by Sam Cassell, who was let out of his contract with the Washington Wizards last month, and Lawrence Frank, who is still under contract with the Brooklyn Nets. While Woodson and Cassell have already spent time at the Clippers' training facility, the new coaching staff will not be formally announced until Frank's situation is resolved. The Clippers lost associate head coach Alvin Gentry, who left for the same position with the Golden State Warriors, and assistant coach Tyronn Lue, who left to become the associate head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Assistant coach Kevin Eastman was promoted to vice president of basketball operations. Rivers previously said he was looking to replace all three on his staff before the start of training camp.
