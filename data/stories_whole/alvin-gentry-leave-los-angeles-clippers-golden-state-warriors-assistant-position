Clippers associate head coach Alvin Gentry is leaving Los Angeles for the same position with the Golden State Warriors, his agent, Warren LeGarie, told Yahoo! Sports. Gentry is the first to join the staff of new Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, who last month signed a five-year deal worth up to $25 million. Kerr and Gentry previously worked together with the Phoenix Suns, where Gentry was the head coach for five seasons before mutually parting ways with the team in January 2013. Kerr was the Suns' general manager for part of Gentry's tenure. Gentry and the Warriors have agreed to a three-year contract that nearly doubles his Clippers salary, a source told Yahoo! Sports. Lawrence Frank, who was an assistant coach under Doc Rivers with the Boston Celtics during the 2010-11 season, is a leading candidate to join Rivers' staff with the Clippers, sources told ESPNLosAngeles.com's Arash Markazi. The Clippers will be looking to add two assistant coaches after assistant coach Kevin Eastman was promoted to vice president of basketball operations earlier this week. Former New York Knicks head coach Mike Woodson is also being considered for a position on the Clippers coaching staff, according to sources. Gentry also was a candidate for head-coaching openings with theÂ Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz this offseason. Sources confirmed to ESPN.com on Thursday that the Cavaliers have offered their position to longtime European coach David Blatt. The Jazz hired Quin Snyder earlier this month. Gentry joined the Clippers last July in a homecoming of sorts. It marked his third stint with the Clippers after previously serving as both head coach (2000-03) and assistant coach (1990-91). He has gone 335-370 as a head coach, including interim stints with the Miami Heat and Detroit Pistons. Sources told Yahoo! Sports that Rivers supported Gentry's move to the Pacific Division-rival Warriors.
