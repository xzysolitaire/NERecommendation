Ready for more Game 7s? We asked our ESPN Forecast panel who would prevail in Round 2 of the playoffs, and it sees both series that begin on Monday night having the potential to go the distance. In the East, the panel thinks the Pacers will knock off the Wizards in seven games despite Indiana looking nothing like a championship contender in Round 1. It also sees the Thunder outlasting the Clippers in seven games for a trip back to the Western Conference finals. Check back tomorrow for our Nets-Heat and Blazers-Spurs predictions. How it works: The ESPN Forecast panel predicted each team's likelihood of winning each of the seven potential games, and each team's likelihood of winning the series. The overall prediction is based on a combination of the mean, median and mode of the predictions for each series.
