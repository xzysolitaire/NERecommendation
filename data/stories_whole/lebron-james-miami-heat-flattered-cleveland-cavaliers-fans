CLEVELAND -- A group of Cleveland Cavaliers fans that raised $50,000 to put up billboards and passed out several thousand "Come Home LeBron" T-shirts on Wednesday night got LeBron James' attention. But they did not get an answer. "It's very flattering," James said before the Miami Heat's 95-84 win over the Cavs. "Anytime you have fans who appreciate the way you play, it's humbling." James, however, stuck with his edict from training camp when it comes to his impending free agency next summer. He is not focusing on it. "I'm not talking about free agency right now," James said. "My only concern is winning a third championship." Early last year, James said he could envision himself returning to play in Cleveland someday if the circumstances worked out. That quickly resulted in a thaw from groups of Cavs fans, and James has been getting more cheers when playing at Quicken Loans Arena over the past two seasons. James, who spends some of his offseason in his native Akron, said he's not focusing on the changing perceptions from 2010, when he was booed heavily after leaving the Cavs in free agency following seven seasons with the team. "I'm not getting too caught up in it," James said. "I'm grateful for [fans changing opinions]. I haven't done the 'Family Feud' thing and surveyed 100 people on the street and said 'Do you like LeBron or not?'" Though he was offered one of the neon green shirts with his face on them that the "Come Home LeBron" campaign was distributing, James declined to accept.
