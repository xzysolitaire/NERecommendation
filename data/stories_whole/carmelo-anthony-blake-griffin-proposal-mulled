With the looming possibility of Carmelo Anthony departing New York as a free agent this summer, New York Knicks officials have discussed proposing a trade to the Los Angeles Clippers for Blake Griffin, according to league sources. Sources say Clippers management also has had internal discussions about such a deal but that the clubs have not yet spoken to one another about a potential trade. As of now, neither team is certain it would make an Anthony-for-Griffin trade, the sources said. The Clippers appear to be the more apprehensive of the two teams because Griffin is having a terrific season, especially of late. The 24-year-old power forward has averaged 26 points and nearly 11 rebounds in his past 10 games. One source close to the situation said the Clippers' latest internal discussion ended in favor of keeping Griffin. New York's top priority, meanwhile, appears to be re-signing Anthony to a long-term deal this offseason. But with the Knicks struggling badly and Anthony refusing to give assurances that he will return, the Knicks understand they must at least consider other options. The Clippers are on the Knicks' radar because it is an open secret throughout the league that Anthony and Clippers star point guard Chris Paul have wanted to play together since 2010. That sentiment between the two players has not changed, according to sources. Paul, who signed a five-year, $107 million deal with the Clippers this offseason, separated his shoulder Friday night against the Dallas Mavericks and is expected to miss three to five weeks. If the Knicks decide to explore a trade for Anthony, he will have plenty of say as to where he goes because of his impending free agency. No club will offer anything of value for him without knowing he will re-sign with it this summer.
