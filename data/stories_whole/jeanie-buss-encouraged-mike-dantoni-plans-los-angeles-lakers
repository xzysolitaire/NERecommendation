Los Angeles Lakers president Jeanie Buss said she has made an effort to get to know Mike D'Antoni and his wife, Laurel, this offseason and is "encouraged" about the coach's plans for the team this season. "I've gotten a chance to know coach D'Antoni and I've learned three things about him," Buss said Thursday on the "Mason & Ireland Show" on ESPNLA 710 radio. "The first and most important is the guy wants to win. I love that about him. "The second thing is we have the same taste in restaurants and food. We live in the same area and we have all the same favorite restaurants. "I've also met his wife. And I have this saying, and maybe I'm patting myself on the back with this one, but behind every great coach is a great woman. And she is a great woman. She's a dynamo." Buss' comments come just weeks after she wrote, in an updated version of her book "Laker Girl," that she felt "betrayed" by the way the Lakers hired D'Antoni over Phil Jackson last fall. Buss is engaged to the former Lakers coach. On Thursday, though, Buss said she was "encouraged" by the direction D'Antoni is taking the team now that he has a training camp and "a roster that's been built for a certain type of offense." Buss was in studio with hosts Steve Mason and John Ireland to announce that the Lakers had extended their radio agreement with ESPNLA for seven years. Ireland will continue as the play-by-play commentator for the Lakers radio broadcasts. Former Laker Mychal Thompson is the color analyst.
