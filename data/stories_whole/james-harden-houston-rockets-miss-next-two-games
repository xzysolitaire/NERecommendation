The Houston Rockets will hold James Harden out of their next two games thanks to a sore foot that has been plaguing the star guard for more than a month. Harden missed Saturday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and will sit out their following game Monday against the Memphis Grizzlies before being re-evaluated. The soreness in Harden's left foot has been troubling him to various degrees since the middle of training camp, according to sources. The 24-year-old Harden is averaging 24.2 points per game -- the sixth-highest average in the NBA -- and a team-leading 5.4 assists this season.
