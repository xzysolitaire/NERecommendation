NEW YORK -- The Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout, Pittsburgh's Andrew McCutchen and Washington's Ian Desmond have won their third straight Silver Slugger Awards. Chicago White Sox rookie first baseman Jose Abreu and Houston second baseman Jose Altuve were among eight first-time winners announced Thursday by Louisville Slugger, which presents the annual honors following voting by major league managers and coaches for the top hitter in each league at every position. Texas third baseman Adrian Beltre won for the fourth time and was joined on the AL team by White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramirez, Cleveland catcher Yan Gomes and Detroit designated hitter Victor Martinez. Trout joined Mike Piazza (1993-95) as the only players to win in each of their first three full big league seasons and was joined in the outfield by Toronto's Jose Bautista and Cleveland's Michael Brantley. The NL team included Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker and Washington's left side of the infield, with Desmond at shortstop and Anthony Rendon at third. McCutchen was picked in the outfield along with Miami's Giancarlo Stanton and Atlanta's Justin Upton. World Series champion San Francisco earned battery honors, with Madison Bumgarner winning at pitcher and Buster Posey at catcher. Brantley, Bumgarner, Gomes, Rendon, Stanton and Walker also were first-time winners. Beltre, Gonzalez and Martinez each earned $100,000 bonuses; Trout $75,000; Brantley, Bumgarner and Posey $50,000 apiece; Altuve $25,000; and Abreu and Ramirez $15,000 each.
