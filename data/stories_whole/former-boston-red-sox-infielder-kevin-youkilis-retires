BOSTON -- Former Boston Red Sox infielder Kevin Youkilis -- "The Greek God of Walks" -- is walking away from the game, his agent said Thursday. Youkilis played parts of nine seasons in Boston and was a part of World Series teams in 2004 and '07. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 2012 and then played an injury-shortened year with the New York Yankees before spending last season in Japan. In his career, Youkilis had a .281 batting average with 150 homers and 618 RBIs. He also walked 539 times, a skill that earned him the nickname "Euclis, the Greek God of Walks," in the book "Moneyball." Youkilis was a member of three All-Star teams and received the 2008 Hank Aaron Award as the best hitter in the AL.
