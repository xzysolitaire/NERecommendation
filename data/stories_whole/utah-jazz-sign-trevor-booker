The Utah Jazz have signed forward Trevor Booker away from the Washington Wizards. The two-year deal is worth $10 million, sources told ESPN.com. Booker's agent confirmed the signing via Twitter. Booker averaged 6.8 points and 5.3 rebounds in 72 games (45 starts) for the Wizards last season. The Wizards had the option of making Booker a restricted free agent last month but decided not to offer him a qualifying offer, and they lost their matching rights. Yahoo! Sports first reported the deal.
