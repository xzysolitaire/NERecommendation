The Texas Rangers have extended the contracts of general manager Jon Daniels and assistant GM Thad Levine, according to multiple sources. Team officials had no comment Thursday night. Each was entering the final year of his contract, but ownership had tremendous confidence in the ability of the pair to push the Rangers into contending status in 2015. The Rangers are coming off a 95-loss campaign, the team's first losing season since 2008. Daniels, whose official title is president, baseball operations/general manager, has been with the organization since 2005. In 2010, Daniels was named Baseball America's Major League Executive of the Year. Levine has been the Rangers' assistant GM since 2005. He spent the previous six seasons with the Colorado Rockies organization. Like Daniels, Levine is highly regarded in baseball circles. He was a candidate for the Arizona Diamondbacks' GM job this offseason before backing out. The Rangers had some turnover in the front office this past season, losing assistant GM A.J. Preller, who left to become the general manager of the San Diego Padres, and senior special assistant to the GM and scouting Don Welke, who also went to the Padres. The signing of Daniels and Levine maintains the continuity ownership wants.
