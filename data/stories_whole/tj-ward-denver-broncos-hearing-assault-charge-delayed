DENVER -- A court hearing for Broncos safety T.J. Ward on charges stemming from an incident at a strip club has been delayed until next month. Ward appeared in a Denver courtroom with his attorney Abraham Hutt on Tuesday morning. Hutt asked the judge for more time because of evidence he just received. The hearing was delayed until Aug. 4. Ward faces misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace charges for allegedly throwing a glass mug at a female bartender May 10 at PT's All Nude Club. He has pleaded not guilty. The 27-year-old signed a four-year, $22.5 million deal with Denver this spring. He is a major component of Denver's defensive makeover this offseason following the AFC champions' loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl. Ward and his attorney left court without comment.
