Los Angeles Lakers forward Ryan Kelly is expected to miss at least six weeks after suffering a tear in his right hamstring during the Lakers' loss to the Golden State Warriors, the team announced Monday. An ultrasound test Monday revealed the tear for Kelly, who has only appeared in three games this season because of hamstring issues. He returned after a lengthy delay to play in Sunday's loss against Golden State, only to leave during the second quarter because of that injury. Kelly averaged 3.7 points and 1.7 rebounds in a reserve role during those games.
