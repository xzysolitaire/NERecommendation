MILWAUKEE -- No charges will be filed in a nightclub fight involving Milwaukee Bucks center Larry Sanders. The Milwaukee County District Attorney's office announced the decision Thursday after reviewing the "altercation" that happened early Sunday. Sanders sat out the Bucks' 109-104 victory Wednesday night over Cleveland because of a sore thumb. The team said Sanders hurt the thumb in the previous game, a loss in the home opener last week to Toronto. Coach Larry Drew said Thursday at practice that Sanders has told him that he should have never put himself in such a position in the first place. "It's unfortunate that it happened but he has to learn from it and I believe that he will. At least I hope he will." Drew said. Sanders missed practice Monday after his wife went into labor. He missed practice Tuesday because of the thumb injury. Sanders signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension in the offseason after a breakout 2012-13 campaign. He's averaging 2.7 points and 3.7 rebounds in three games so far this season. The Bucks host Dallas on Saturday night.
