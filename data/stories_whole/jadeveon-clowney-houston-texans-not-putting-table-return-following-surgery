HOUSTON -- Texans outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney is working his through way through rehab after having sports hernia surgery a week ago. Â As for a timetable on a return, Clowney wouldn't say. "The pain, the injury's getting better every day, day by day," Clowney said. "Just looking forward to getting healthy and looking forward to training camp." Clowney, the first overall pick in May's draft, underwent surgery last week in Philadelphia. Coach Bill O'Brien said he expected Clowney -- who signed a four year, fully-guaranteed $22.27 million deal -- to be ready for training camp in July. There were reports of a groin issue during Clowney's pro day in April, but the outside linebacker said this issue wasn't something he dealt with before arriving in Houston. "Just when I got here, they wanted to check me out and I told them there was a little pain," Clowney said. "They were like we just don't want it to linger over into the season, so we got it taken care of before anything happened." The Texans finished their mandatory minicamp on Thursday with a shortened practice. Clowney spent the team's organized team activities and rookie minicamp learning how to transition from defensive end to outside linebacker. "We feel like he is on track," O'Brien said. "Again, a little setback here with the sports hernia, but he's been in all of the meetings and he's an instinctive guy and he's a hard-working guy." Players will now have about one month off before training camp begins. But Clowney, like all the Texans' rookies, has been advised by his head coach to stick around. "It's a crucial time," O'Brien said. "It's really for the players; it is interesting, it's not really a vacation time. They need to make sure that they stay in condition, that they stay knowledgeable with the playbook, stay strong and do the things necessary to come back here in the best shape of their lives." For Clowney that will mean continuing the rehab he started right after his surgery.
