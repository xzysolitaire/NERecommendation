On Friday morning, the decision the NBA world had been waiting for came down, as LeBron James announced he would be returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers in free agency. Reaction came in quickly from all corners on social media after James' tweet, which linked to his first-person SI.com letter. Cavs owner Dan GilbertÂ welcomed him back to Cleveland in a far different manner than how he had reacted to James' decision in 2010. And Heat owner Micky Arison wished James well on his way out of Miami. NBA players -- including future teammates of James' -- had varied reactions to the news.
