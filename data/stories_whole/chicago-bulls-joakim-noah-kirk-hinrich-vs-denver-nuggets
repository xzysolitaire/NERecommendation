CHICAGO -- Joakim Noah (groin) and Kirk Hinrich (shoulder) did not play in Friday night's preseason finale against the Denver Nuggets. Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau remains hopeful the pair will be able to play in Tuesday night's regular-season opener against the Miami Heat. "We'll see," he said before Friday's home game. "They were good today, better. I want them to go through some practices first and we'll see where they are." Noah was out most of the preseason while dealing with the groin injury. The All-Star center only played in one game, and Thibodeau has been frustrated by the fact Noah is "deconditioned." Meanwhile, Hinrich suffered a concussion Oct. 18 after falling into rookie Erik Murphy's knee. Thibodeau said Thursday the concussion is no longer the issue for Hinrich, but a shoulder injury that he sustained during the fall concerns the team most.
