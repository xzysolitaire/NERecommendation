PITTSBURGH -- Pittsburgh Penguins forward Pascal Dupuis will miss Tuesday night's game in Montreal with an unspecified injury. Coach Mike Johnston says Dupuis met with doctors Monday morning and will not accompany the team for the trip. Johnston says the team will have an update on Wednesday. The 35-year-old has six goals and five assists in 16 games for Pittsburgh. Dupuis missed the majority of the 2013-14 season after tearing the ACL in his right knee. Pittsburgh defenseman Olli Maatta will be a game-time decision Tuesday. The 20-year-old underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his thyroid earlier this month. "Mentally for sure, I want to get out there. It's been a couple weeks since I've played, so yeah, I'm hungry there," Maatta told the team's official website. "But I've got to still take it easy, not rush it. But we'll see (Tuesday)."
