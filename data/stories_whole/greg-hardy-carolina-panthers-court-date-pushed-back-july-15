Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who faces assault charges stemming from a fight with his girlfriend, is scheduled to appear in court July 15, his attorney confirmed to ESPN.com on Tuesday. Hardy was originally scheduled to appear in court on misdemeanor charges Friday. However, attorney Chris Fialko said a crowded docket of cases is the reason the date was pushed back. The Panthers are set to open training camp July 25. Hardy, 25, was charged with assault and threats against Nicole Holder, a 24-year-old woman he had been involved with since September. He was arrested immediately after the May 13 incident, and was released on $17,000 bond and ordered to stay away from Holder. Holder has been subpoenaed to appear in court on July 15 as well. Hardy rejoined his teammates for organized team activities six days after the arrest. The team's sack leader in 2013 with 15 was ordered to attend three Alcoholic Anonymous classes a week and turn over all firearms and weapons. He turned in an assortment of semi-automatic weapons and shotguns in the process. Hardy has been accused of throwing Holder into a tile tub, choking her and throwing her onto a couch "covered in assault rifles and/or shotguns,'' according to the arrest warrant. Holder also said in the warrant that her "short-lived relationship'' with rapper Nelly led to Hardy's aggression.
