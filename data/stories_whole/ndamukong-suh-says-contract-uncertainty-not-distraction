DETROIT -- Ndamukong Suh is ready to start training camp -- and he says any uncertainty about his contract shouldn't be a distraction. "That's what you've got agents for," the Lions defensive tackle said. "They can take care of business, and just go from there." Veterans report to camp Sunday, and the Lions will practice Monday. Suh is entering the final season of his contract, and as always, the spotlight will be on the two-time All-Pro when he takes the field for Detroit. Suh does not seem overly concerned about the status of contract talks. "I don't have a timetable," Suh said. "That's my agent. I don't have to worry about it. I can focus on football, and that's my job, and that's what I'm going to do." Due to a restructuring of Suh's original rookie contract, he is due $22.4 million against the salary cap this season. If the Lions are unable to re-sign him, they would have to decide whether or not to use the franchise tag on him for the 2015 season, which would come at a cost of $26.7 million.
