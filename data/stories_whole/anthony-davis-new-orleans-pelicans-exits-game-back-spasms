DENVER -- New Orleans forward Anthony Davis left Wednesday night's 137-107 loss to the Nuggets with back spasms. Davis scored six points and grabbed three rebounds in 10 minutes before leaving the game in the second quarter, with his team trailing by double digits. Davis was playing his second straight game after sitting out one with a sprained ankle. He was playing against the Nuggets despite taking an elbow to the face from Sacramento forward Reggie Evans on Monday night. Davis is averaging 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and a league-leading 2.9 blocks a game this season, his second in the NBA.
