Philadelphia 76ers rookie center Nerlens Noel, who hasn't played a minute while rehabbing his knee, said Monday that there's a chance he could see some action later this season. "There's a possibility," Noel told SiriusXM NBA Radio. "We're just taking our time with it, being cautious with things," Noel said. "I'm definitely worried about my health, but regards to the whole season, that decision hasn't been made up. I still have to meet up with my doctors -- Dr. [James] Andrews and Dr. Kevin Wilk -- and come to a conclusion with that." The Sixers are being very cautious with Noel, which is the reason he probably won't play until 2014-15. With that being said, he might be able to play during the last few games this season in April just to give him some confidence going into the summer. While Noel is rehabbing his knee, he is also working with the coaching staff to reform his offensive skills, including his jump shot. "I think he's doing fine," Sixers coach Brett Brown told the Philadelphia Daily News. "I think his spirits are fine, I think his body, physically, continues to develop and look good. He likes wearing those tight shirts, and I'm proud of him. If I had a body like that, I'd do the same. Physically, he's coming around and buying into it. His shot is continuing to develop. We've kept a real simple plan and a consistent plan." It was not originally the Sixers' plan to sit Noel -- the No. 6 overall pick, who had surgery to repair the ACL in his left knee in March -- for the entire season. He suffered the injury Feb. 12 while playing for the Kentucky Wildcats. The timetable for Noel's recovery was initially set for six to eight months, which was expected to allow him to return sometime in the middle of his rookie season. Andrews, who performed the surgery, told ESPN in June that Noel was ahead of schedule.
