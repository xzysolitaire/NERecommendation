METAIRIE, La. -- The New Orleans Pelicans say guard Tyreke Evans has undergone minor arthroscopic surgery to clean out scar tissue in his right knee. The club says the procedure was performed Wednesday and that Evans will start six to eight weeks of rehabilitation immediately. Evans played in 72 games this season, averaging 14.5 points, 5.0 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 28.2 minutes. He began the season as a reserve but became a starter after several teammates were injured. Playing mostly shooting guard and sometimes point guard, his production rose significantly, including a career-high 41 points in a victory over Oklahoma City. Pelicans coach Monty Williams has not ruled out keeping Evans in the starting lineup next season, even with a healthy roster.
