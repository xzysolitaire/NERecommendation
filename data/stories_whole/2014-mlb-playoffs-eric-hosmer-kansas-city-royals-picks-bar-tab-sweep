Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer helped power Kansas City to the ALCS and then fueled the afterparty at McFadden's -- 10 minutes west from Kauffman Stadium on I-70 -- the best way he knew how. Hosmer, according to local reports, arrived with several teammates after they finished off a sweep with their 8-3 win over the Angels and picked up the tab for everyone in attendance at the Irish bar in Kansas City's Power & Light District for the last hour of the night. Hosmer spent $3,000 on the early Monday morning bar tab, and his teammates shared a $12,000 bill, the Kansas City Star reported, citing a Royals official. In video shot at McFadden's, Hosmer, Royals closer Greg Holland and others can be seen shooting champagne at a capacity crowd. The Royals return to the field for Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday at Baltimore. Some of the revelers were drawn at least in part by a Hosmer invitation via Twitter:
