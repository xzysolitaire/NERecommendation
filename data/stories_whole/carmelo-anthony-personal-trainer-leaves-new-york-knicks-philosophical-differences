GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- New York Knicks player development coach Idan Ravin, the personal trainer to Carmelo Anthony, has left the team due to philosophical differences with the coaching staff, league sources told ESPNNewYork.com. The Knicks hired Ravin earlier this season to work closely with players on shooting, fitness and general development. Prior to the Knicks, Ravin worked as a personal trainer to some of the top players in the NBA, including Anthony and Chris Paul. He also has worked extensively with Knicks guard J.R. Smith. It is unclear if the Knicks will fill the vacancy, as his hiring was perceived as a perk for Anthony, who will test free agency this summer, and Smith, who re-signed with the Knicks over the summer. It is unclear if Ravin's departure will have an impact on Anthony's pending free-agency decision. Due to rules in the collective bargaining agreement, Anthony can make more money if he re-signs with the Knicks instead of another suitor. With New York, Anthony could ink a maximum five-year contract worth $129,135,806. If he signs with another team, the maximum he can earn is $95,897,372 over four years, according to calculations by ESPN salary-cap expert Larry Coon.
